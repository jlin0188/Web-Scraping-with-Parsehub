Seattle, WA","True to its name, this place serves up a mean sandwich! There are good restaurants, and then there are restaurants whose food is worthy of random cravings that could happen on any day at any time. Mean sandwich falls squarely in the latter category for me.
The Midnight At the Oasis, the falafel-based sandwich, is one of the best vegan sandwiches I've had anywhere. It simply can't be beet ;)
The chicken cutlet sandwich is SO delicious - it's the one I crave the most when I think of Mean Sandwich.
I've also had one bite of my friend's fish sandwich, which I found to be tasty with inventive flavors.
I'm not a huge fan of the potato skins and ins - I find them to be too crisp and browned for my tastes, but that won't keep me from coming back for the sandwiches (I do wish they offered an additional side dish option or two, though)!",,,

San Francisco, CA","We snuck into Mean Sandwich just before they were going to close for Thanksgiving week. So lucky us. Unluckily they were doing a fried chicken pop-up that same day and it was bonkers inside with lots of people and orders backed up in the kitchen. They did offer to send our food to the brewery next door if we chose to wait there instead but we decided to walk around the neighborhood and come back.
We ordered the steak tartare club and a side of salt and pepper 'skins and ins. It took about 35 minutes for our food. The steak tartare is labor intensive so due to the rush they were batching them as orders came in I think.
Worth it though! What an incredible idea to substitute steak tartare in spicy yuzu mayo for the T in the BLT. And with chewy dense rye bread. The sandwich doesn't look like much but I recommend sharing if you want to include a generous helping of skins as well.
Speaking of which, why has no one else thought about deep frying potato skins? Wonderfully salty, peppery, crispy with yummy soft potato insides. Dangerously addictive and filling. Goes great with beer :-).
Definitely want to come back and try the Midnight at the Oasis next time we're in town.",,,

Manhattan, NY","Such a great spot!
The burger here is smashed to perfection with very crispy sides and juicy throughout. I'm not a fan of mustard or raw onions on a burger but boy, do they go well with this burger at Mean Sandwich. I'm a fan!
The ""fries"" are not really fries but fried potatoes with skin. I suspect they're baked first and then fried later: Whatever they do with them, they're quite magical :) Crispy skins with the meaty center in that spud.
If you've been to any Fredy's Steakhouse chain location, this is an elevated version of that kind of a burger.
I had a chat with the staff present and they were really friendly and engaging in conversation.
Can't wait to be back for more!",,,

San Diego, CA","Case of ordering wrong? Not sure. We actually made a u-turn to hit up this place to grab some lunch to go for our road trip up north. I always trust a local fav from yelp and the amount of patrons waiting for food further supported that. However, the combination of super long wait, high price and lackluster sandwiches have left me feeling a bit bitter abouts things.
I ordered the Buon Appetito (chicken cutlet sandwich) and the Jersey Sub (Italian sub) which are both $12. I thought it would be a quick process but the shop is small and it was very busy with orders going one at a time. It seemed like there was a combo of 4 or 5 people in the place ahead of me and who knows how many remote ordering. Pro tip (apparently) order ahead for pickup. I think my wait for 2 sandwiches was at least 25 mins.
Out of the 2, the Buon appetito was better, but still mediocre. But the Jersey was just plain bad. Whatever sub roll bread is used tasted like cheap white bread and was probably the primary reason it tasted badly... bread is important. It was just really plain tasting. I hate feeling so strongly on this but for nearly $30 for 2 sandwiches and being in a hurry, this visit was a big mistake and I should have just gotten sandwiches at Safeway for half the price.",,,

Seattle, WA","The buon appetito sandwich, which is a fried chicken sandwich, was lackluster IMO. There wasn't much flavor and there was way too much bread and not enough chicken. I asked for a side of pickles to jazz it up. The menu is heavy on meats, slaws, pickled stuff, and buffalo sauce, which is not my personal fave but many others will love.
On the bright side, this place is dog friendly with a huge patio out back including ping pong and cornhole! It would be a great place to go with a group of friends. We went at a weird time, like 4 pm on a Thursday, and there was no one else there!",,,

Seattle, WA","Had a mean sandwich (corned beef, cabbage, mustard, mint and maple syrup) with falafel added - was such a great sandwich. They source their meats locally, make their own falafel (really good) and are just the type of place you would want to go to after a few brews (or even pick up a sandwich at lunch)
Highly recommend.",,,

I had the falafel sandwich and it was bomb. The pickles on it had a great tang to balance out the falafel. It was definitely Scout-Approved and we will be back!",,,

Alexandria, VA","Oyster po'boy was amazing. I had it with a pilsner, which enhanced the experience. My family and I came here after visiting the Nordic Museum, and I'm glad we did. Initially we were going to go to the brewery next door after ordering sandwiches, but they were closed that day. Turns out that was OK, because we still got good beer with our sandwiches. The po'boy was slightly spicy, which I thought was delicious. It was a generous size, so I left feeling satisfied and refreshed. The space isn't exactly what I'd call ""comfortable,"" but that's OK because I was focused on the FOOD. Plus, they had puppy videos playing on the large TV in the corner. Who knew there was a channel dedicated to adorable pets? I couldn't help but smile and laugh.",,,
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,"Sheri C.
Seattle, WA","Spent the afternoon with a friend who suggested we come here for lunch. She told me she had been here before and that I would like it; she was spot on.
Mean Sandwich is a small shop in Ballard that has no frills. Featured in Bon Appetit's 2017 List of America's Best New Restaurants, which I was informed about by my friend, I was intrigued to find a pretty basic menu: 7 sandwiches with 3 daily specials (soup may be one), 1 salad, 3 kinds of fat potato skins: salt & pepper or buffalo sauce or loaded-cheese/chives/bacon bits/more cheese, and yesterday's bun bread pudding.
While my friend and I were staring at the menu trying to decide what to order, a member of BOH came out, started singing loudly along with the 80's song playing and a huge grin. ""What should I get?!"" belted out my friend. ""Buon Appetito,"" he replied. She gushed. He kept singing. She informed me I had to get the skins and share them with her, so we got the salt and pepper.
Buon Appetito is a chicken sandwich with buffalo mayo, provolone, tomato, lettuce, and a pickled pepper relish. It looked huge. It was. My bud ended up taking half the sandwich home for later.
I got the Jersey Sub: capicola, provolone, salami, ham, lettuce, tomato, oregano, oil & vinegar (I asked for no red onion). Amazingly good. Crazy filling. The BREAD, man, the bread. It was like home, only a home I've never had.
Their icon is a pair of lady's lips with red lipstick, and they had free stickers. We each grabbed one. I slapped mine on the back of my day planner which is now in the recycling bin somewhere, and I really, really want to go back and get another sticker. And a sandwich.
You can get delivery. You can get catering. Adult beverages are available. I stuck with a bottle of root beer.
Outdoor seating where your pooch can also sit is available. Tables indoors along with bar stools facing the windows.
Food: 5
Service: 5
Ambiance: 4
Parking: 3 - It's freaking Ballard",,,

Seattle, WA","I would definitely go back but ratios of sandwiches can be off at times. The guys working there are super nice and the place is spotless. If your lucky to be there when it's open, get a sandwich and if you aren't hungry, get one for later.
Example of poor ratio: is The Fish is really good when you get the right bite and you get a bit of everything. However the sardines are like 10% of the sandwich. The bread is like 40% the sandwich and at times your just eating bread, which is also really good but I want something in between it. Also the fish is between. The lettuce and the slaw so one bite and half of the fish slides right out the back. Next, thing you know your eating a vegan sandwich of slaw and lettuce.",,,

Seattle, WA","So this review is going to go beyond the incredible sandwiches and touch on the awesome customer experience at Mean Sandwich. We came based on the rumors of a delicious sandwich and were not disappointed. The Mean Corned Beef was awesome. A great version of a staple, including mint to add a touch of sweet flavor. The potato sides were also awesome. The part I really want to highlight though is Dan. When I asked what he recommended, he actually asked questions and gave great guidance. He also checked in on us to see if we were enjoying our sandwiches and asked what we thought of our selections. On our way out the door he thanked us for visiting. I know this all seems minor compared to the food but in today's hipster Seattle food scene I think it's rare to find a spot that not only has great food but also great people that appreciate their customers. Go for the awesome sandwiches, return for the great people!",,,

When I saw maple syrup and mint on the menu I thought it was weird, but it really balances the sandwich well. Overall a great sandwich, I'd love to come back to try other sandwiches, the skins and ins, and play corn hole and ping pong in their courtyard.",,,

Seattle, WA","Mean Sandwich is a high quality sandwich place in the south end of Seattle's Ballard. It serves a limited range of well-produced sandwiches.
The restaurant is in an easy location to reach near the bridge. Parking nearby is limited and we were lucky to find a space in relatively short walking distance. We had come for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy.
Inside there is a very limited set of seating. This is a place that probably works best for takeout, since I wouldn't have felt really confident we could sit down, and don't want to let my food get cold. Service was counter-style, and friendly.
The menu is very limited. I knew this going in, but when faced with the actual choices, there are really only two that appeal to me much and really only one I definitely want.
There is a very appealing sounding side (fried potato lumps called skins and ins). This is exactly the sort of thing I typically love, but it was a bit overcooked and oversalted and I liked it but didn't love it, which was the big disappointment of the visit. I had expected this to be the high point.
When the sandwich arrived, it was great quality. I had a Buon Appetito (chicken). The bread is super - which I think is what tends to be most important. Not too sweet or soft. Great bread. The filling was a bit less exciting. It tasted like pretty normal sandwich fare. Not bad in any way, but not amazing. The portions were giant. With the skins, both of us had about twice as much food as we needed for a lunch and should have shared (except that we wanted completely different things).
Overall, this is a pretty good sandwich place. Much better than most of the regular chains or local places. If something from their tiny selection appeals to you, I recommend a visit. I doubt we'll be going very often, because we didn't bond with the choices we made and there isn't much more we want to try.",,,

I think we were oversold on the sandwiches. The hype hurt.
These were solid sandwiches.
The Mean, JCVH and Italian were ok. Nothing stellar. Ironically our veg in the group really loved the falafel sandwich. I agreed and felt a little cheated with my choice of the Italian and the too vinegary sauce and almost Jersey Mike's level of presentation.
I had and have high hopes that some adjustments will help this place live up to the hype like Dingfelders was finally able to do after some adjustments.",,,

Tried the Mai Tai and the Kingston Club (I think that's what it was called) and both were delicious and strong. We tried the artichoke fritters for a light bite and I was not a fan. They were way too doughy for my liking and all together didn't have a ton of flavor.

Seattle, WA","Corvus had been a favorite for drinks, food, and brunch. Reasonably priced, friendly service, and decent acoustics made this a quiet standout. But the last few times have been disappointing, and last night brought back an old gripe about the new waitstaff that has landed in the Puget Sound area: they aren't professional. We arrived in time for happy hour, and ordered food from it. We also ordered two cocktails -- the menu said ""ALL COCKTAILS $2 OFF."" The toddy was ok, a little heavy-handed with the dried spices, and the Last Word was unbalanced, with too much sour competing with the Luxardo and both overwhelming the chartreuse. I could have sent it back, but wasn't in the mood to be ""that guy."" Food was fine as always, especially the fried okra and chickpeas.
When the the bill arrived, it showed the HH for happy hour pricing, but not on the Last Word. I pointed out the wording on the menu, and the waitress told me she only works one night a week and to take it up with the management/owner. No further help from her. Her service was basic, nothing stellar, but that last comment showed how little she cared about customers and the restaurant. Typically I would have sought out management and voiced my concerns, but last night I just wanted to get on with my evening.
It is a small matter, but I hope management clarifies their drink policy or gives staff the ability to make things right.",,,

Yesterday, it seems that other customers thought the French toast was such good stuff that it was all gone by the time I arrived, just after 1 pm. The server suggested ""Australian unicorn toast"" as a substitute; it's the special of the day because it was the Australian bartender's birthday. It was a slice of thick toast, sliced diagonally, and served with whipped butter and syrup - pretty much the way French toast would be served, except without the egg batter coating. The portion size was too small, but it was only $3, so I ordered another portion. That was about right, and my tab ended up smaller than usual.
Service has generally been good.
The decor is nice, with a lot of cool art - though strangely (given the place's name) there's only a small picture of a crow on one wall, and a giant picture of an owl on the long wall opposite the bar.
We were seated close to the front door on a cold day, but it didn't feel drafty. I'm not sure how they manage that, but they're doing something right.",,,

I ordered the cacio e pepe and a slice of sourdough bread through uber eats. The flavor of the cacio e pepe is quite different from what I've had before, I think it's the aged cheese that really made the difference. It was delicious though! The pasta was perfectly cooked (& fresh!) and the 'sauce' still had a really good pepper flavor. The sourdough also came with a light drizzle of olive oil and salt which complemented the pasta perfectly.

Interesting casual dining pasta place up in Cap Hill. I was looking to support local restaurants still open during the shelter at home mandate in effect and luckily they are still open for take out.
Stuff tried:
Eggplant parmesan: i am only person i know that actually craves eggplant parm. The version here is not crispy at all but it is exceedingly delicious! My only gripe is that the portion size is tiny. If you are remotely hungry i would order two servings.
Mushroom with truffle oil on healthy pasta: i am a sucker for mushroom truffle oil anything. Chose the healthy pasta which is made from some type of bean flour instead of wheat giving it a toothy consistency. The pasta has touted health benefits but the consistency might be offputting for some folks. Flavor was pretty good however
Bruschetta caprese: nice slab of grilled bread with fresh toppings. I admit that the to go version seems to have left my bruschetta a bit soggy. Eat this first next time",,,

Oakland, CA","The pasta was very tasty! Excellent. If I had eaten on-site, I'd probably rate higher. I love that you can really taste the truffle oil in the mushroom pasta dish. The pomodoro was simple but hit the spot.
However, I ordered delivery through Yelp/Grub Hub and it was an awful wait. On yelp, it said 30-50 min wait time. However I waited 1.5 hours or 40 mins to 1 hour more wait time than I expected. I was tired and hadn't eaten for more than 9 hours so I picked the place that could be the least amount of wait. The restaurant blamed the grub hub driver, and when I called grub hub they weren't taking calls. After my 3rd call to grub hub, they also blamed the driver and gave me a lousy 10% discount for my next purchase.
I'd probably eat here again but NEVER use delivery.",,,

Shoreline, WA","I love pasta and have been to just about every Italian spot in Seattle. Handmade pasta, I'm there! Pasta in a casual setting, even better! Most often though, I don't have access to the likes of Il Corvo, Pasta Casalinga, G.H. Pasta, Ristorante Machiavelli, Tavolata, or La Vita e Bella because I currently don't work in Seattle.
However, the very first Yelper I ever met is credited for the recommendation to Due' Cucina Italiana *Bryan K* Clearly, I had been under a rock and late to the pasta bowl party at this popular Capitol Hill/Broadway spot. I've interacted with the two brothers than run DCI, great charismatic business owners. Brilliant concept and business hours until 2200! Great counter staff and efficient kitchen crew. A variety of seating are available whether dining solo, pairs or larger groups. Just remember to kindly bus your table at the end!
My first visit was back in December 2018 (been open since October 2016!) and have been back so many times that honestly I've lost count. This is a long overdue Yelp review as I just had a custom pasta bowl for dunch/linner hours ago (1/27/20).
Assorted fresh pasta that's crafted on site. Your pasta bowl is customized by selecting type of pasta, sauce, and other ingredients from the giant wall signage. Order and pay at the counter, then find a place to sit if dining onsite. There's also brisk takeout and delivery traffic.
In about 15-20 minutes your name is called or check the status on the order monitor. I like to admire my pasta bowl and then dig in while nice and hot. Feeling raveneous, one can easily polish off a bowl. Most often, I have tasty leftovers for another meal.
Another item I've had often (but not today) is their delicious tiramisu. Enough to share, or not!
So thank you Bryan K, Due' Cucina Italiana has become one of my regular spots.
High quality, delicious, affordable, satisfying, highly recommended!",,,

Seattle, WA","Had a lovely lunch here recently! The place is modern, clean, well lit (large windows) with plenty of open seating. Remember to seat yourself & bus your own table. My group tried a variety of the sauces...
- traditional bolognese: rich, hearty, filling
- cacio & pepe: the cheese flavor was very sharp and strong, delicious but a bit too much for me
- amatriciana: lots of tomato flavors + smokey, savory goodness in the form of guanciale (cured pork cheek)
- mushroom & white truffle oil: creamy, thick, but not too heavy. Wonder, well balanced flavors between the mushroom and truffle oil (personal favorite out of the 4 sauces)
The pastas were all fresh and perfectly al dente (firm, chewy). Personally enjoyed the rigatoni and ca campanelle best. Would recommend and come back again!",,,

My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.

Seattle, WA","We came here on a Thursday evening for a double date to celebrate a couple birthdays and it was packed! Due Cucina Italiana is an order-upon-entry, seat-yourself, and bus-your-own-table establishment. Luckily our friends had arrived earlier than us and were able to snag a table.
The ordering steps are as follows: choose a sauce, choose a pasta, order add-ons or drinks if wanted, sit and watch the screen until your order is ready.
Holy guacamole this place is good! Although the rest of my party ordered the bolognese ragu, I decided on the mushroom and white truffle oil sauce with campanelle pasta and pork sausage. The wait for our food was about 15 minutes, but the food is freshly prepared after your order is placed. The portions are extremely generous for the price, and it's very obvious that the pasta is fresh and perfectly al dente.
I will definitely be back to try the other sauce and pasta options. AND DESSERTS! ;)",,,

I'm a huge fan of white tile on white grout walls because it really brightens up the place. The servers are super friendly and nice. Food came out in less than ten minutes. It's cool to see all the pasta being made behind the counter. The place is really clean.
FOOD
We went with the Mushroom and White Truffle Oil with Pork Sausage and the Traditional Bolognese both with their recommended pastas. You could definitely taste the freshness of the pasta (not that I had any doubt because they literally make it behind the counter). The noodles had a great bounce, while still remaining a perfect al dente.
The sauces were great, but honestly just didn't fit my preferred palette. Completely a personal thing. The wine hints in the bolognese were too pronounced for my liking. I prefer a meatier and drier bolognese. It was hard to taste the truffle in the other dish. Then again it's $13, you can't expect much. I would have preferred more cream, but again, it's just personal preference!

I got the traditional bolognese and I was expecting it to have lots of sauce and flavour but the toppings tasted off and it was too dry. My pasta also took a long time to prepare compared to my friends so I thought it would be super fresh but it wasn't at all. I recommend skipping this restaurant if you're looking for Italian food.,,,

Seattle, WA","My biggest complaint is that our pastas were NOT hot. It was a warm, but not close to hot! Lasagna was hot. We were waiting at the counter before they even called my name since I saw we were next up.
- Mushroom and white truffle with added pork sausage. This was our favorite. My sister's bowl had more sauce than ours, which I think is better as ours was a bit dry. What's with the inconsistency?
-Smoked salmon spaghetti: as you can see from my photo we had very little salmon compared to other customers' photos and the restaurant website's photos. WTH?! It was mostly noodles with a few piece of salmon and a pile of greens. Totally not what everyone else's pics look like.
- Lasagna Bolognese: I've definitely had better. Would probably choose the regular bolognese pasta over this.
- bell pepper bruschetta: too salty, but a nice change from a regular caprese
- tiramisu: delicious!
Pros: fresh pastas are cooked to perfection. Price is on point.
They do not take reservations. You order at the cashier, and then wait for them to call your name. It's really loud inside so there's board that tells you when they are ready for you to come up to the counter to get your food to carry back to your table. And the bowls/plates are heavy. You have to get your own water in the back. Also you are required to bus your own table. So what exactly did I add a tip for? I guess I should have read the other reviews. Maybe that's how they keep their prices reasonable. I was so excited to come here after being in Italy 1 month ago, and chose this restaurant for a night out with friends. With the inconsistency of salmon portion (and mushroom sauce), and failure of the proper temp of the pasta, I feel disappointed.",,,

Being from Vancouver, I never thought there'd be a place like this. Wanting Italian food always means paying significantly more for a fine dining experience.

My plate of pasta was also undercooked and tough. The sauces were mostly good, except the Amatriciana was a too salty and way too much cheese it was overpowering.

San Francisco, CA","Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine.",,,

I used to live in Boston where I was lucky to have experienced authentic Italian food in the North End area of the city. Being able to get home-y Italian food is one of the things I miss the most about Boston and Pomodoro fills that void for me.

She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xD
There's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.

Seattle, WA","I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen.
To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was saut茅ed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy.
For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them.",,,

I would say that Pomodoro is pricier than some others (e.g. Ristorante Machiavelli) but it more than makes up with the personal touch and the fact that you can get a table way more easily! Located on the relatively quiet Eastlake Avenue - it's almost easy to miss, but their handmade pastas, and dessert (tiramisu and creme brulee) are a must-try. Almost every pasta and special I have tried so far has been delicious so I can't recommend anything specific but highlight recommend a visit here! With 1 entree per person, a dessert and a bottle of wine, it may end up costing you close to $40-50 a pop.",,,

Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and 鈥媗ight cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!
Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!

The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil!
For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing!

Bellevue, WA","My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time.
The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.
I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though!
The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine.",,,

Sacramento, CA","I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first.
For dessert I got the creme br没l茅e. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme br没l茅e. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price.
Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!

Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.

Seattle, WA","I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning.",,,

Seattle, WA","I've been to Machiavelli 3 or 4 times now but my opinion of it goes down each time. While the food + price is 5 stars, the wait time & experience makes me feel miserable. Here's my most recent (Tuesday night!) experience:
I arrive and meet two of my friends who are sitting on a bench in the entry hall. Our 4th friend is running late so we can't put our name down yet. This entry hall is maybe 4 feet wide with a small bench & people streaming in and out past the small horde of people waiting. Claustrophobic. After 10 minutes or so, some seats open up in the slightly less crowded bar area. We sit and it's bearable but not like we actually get anything to drink since a) no one comes by to take such an order & b) we're here to eat Italian food not drink shitty alcohol. The clincher is that after our 4th arrives, I have to jostle for position with the other prospective diners as we flag down a harried receptionist who exasperatedly writes our names on the wait list. After 20 minutes, we're finally ready to begin waiting for a table.
Many other restaurants in Capitol Hill also have bad wait times but they usually also:
- Take a phone number & call/text when the table is ready.
Or
- Let you put your name down before your whole party is there.",,,

FOOD-
While waiting for the table, we hung around the bar and ordered few drinks and small plates. They were okay. We ordered the main course as soon as we got seated. The bread was good, soft and fresh. Its free for the first time and you pay on from the second order. We got the Spinach Ravioli and my Veal Saltimbocca and they both were so yummy! Worth the wait time definitely.",,,

Seattle, WA","I am sooo glad I found this cute little place! Shoutout to my boyfriend for finding it on his Yelp search!
This cute little place was packed when we got there around 8pm on a Friday night. We put or name down (they quoted as an hour) and went elsewhere for a drink because the bar area was packed as well. The layout of the restaurant is a bit odd and a little difficult to get in and out with people wait on the bench but I think it adds to its charm. Just be prepared to wait but there are tons of places around to grab a drink or explore :)
We came back an hour later. And they called two names that didn't show and then we were up! They quoted us time perfectly. Going into the restaurant area you can see why it's such a long wait. I think I counted about 14 tables for the entire restaurant.
We sat down. Got bread. We ordered drinks. Drinks came so fast. We got a half carafe of red wine. And then we ordered. And our food came. It was such fast and great service! We felt cared for but also didn't feel like they were bothering us all the time. The bread is from Macrina bakery and it was delish! Our pastas that we got were UNREAL. Such good portions sizes and DELICIOUS.
Best part of this was that it was $44 before tip and we were stuffed and had leftovers. That's definitely a STEAL!!
Probably are new go to date night spot. Seriously love this place.",,,

We were here on a Friday night and got to the restaurant about 5:15 and they were just about full, even after opening at 5. As an appetizer we ordered the Bresaola Alla Valtinellese which is cured beef, olive oil and lemon topped with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese. My friend ordered the fettuccine carbonara and I ordered the lasagna bolognese. Both were excellent, although I would have liked to have had more bolognese sauce. Noticed that in between some of the layers of lasagna there was nothing but pasta on top of pasta. Wine was nothing exceptional. Didn't order dessert but now wish I had as they featured a chocolate mousse tiramisu. Big regret there. Small cozy bar with good music.",,,

I'm Italian and from NY--my standards for Italian food are high.
Seattle has a way of taking any type of soul food & making it unapproachable, so when searching through all of the restaurants I was reluctant.
I was given a few Italian restaurant suggestions, but they all were an abrupt ""no"". Through my own search, I found Machievelli. I was hesitant at first--bc yelp photos make it seem like a pizza shop--but
Took a chance.
I was blown away.
There are TWO rooms, a bar area /waiting room and a romantically lit dining room.
Tiny, but the feel and smell brought back NY memories.
I was seated with bread. Thank goodness. Put away 3 plates myself.
Gave them additional tests & ordered the traditional antipast, eggplant parm, & tiramisu.
WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!
They are a restaurant I will forever go to --and send people to!
Bring cash trust me.

We were 3 people and shared the red pepper penne with shrimp, the carbonara and a half-carafe of wine! We ended up paying about $25 a pop.

Pittsburg, CA",A friend referred me here. We we're in Seattle and our hotel was only two blocks away. We decided to come here for valentines. I can't really judge the wait based on going on the busiest holiday in the year. The is a small but really cute restaurant. As soon as you walk in there's a bench you can sit at if you need to wait. There's a good size bar with tables to the right. Up two steps is the hostess. Once you go to what is considered the second floor it's a small restaurant. I almost felt like I was in a home. The bread and oil they gave with the bread was really good. I ordered a Cesar salad that was pretty good too. My husband ordered your typical spaghetti and meat balls. To my surprise it was pretty authentic and very delicious. I ordered pasta with a white sauce and prawns. My dish was just as good if not better. The service was very good and professional. I would definitely be returning.,,,

Seattle, WA","It has been a long time since I've been here and on a Friday night there was about a 45 minute wait. The good thing about their waitlist is, if you miss your spot they'll put you in line for the next table so it is not like you have to wait all over again.
I don't really enjoy the atmosphere of this place and that's the main reason for me not coming back. It's crowded and loud and not in the least bit romantic if you're looking to come here for a date. That being said, I did enjoy the food. The Caesar salad had a good dressing and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I loved my linguine vongole and that was definitely the better of the two pasta dishes but I think I would be smart and just get takeout next time.

If I had to make one recommendation, it would be to try the linguine and clams. Don't forget a wine pairing!
Full warning, there's essentially no parking in this area of capitol hill so you should walk or take a ride share. There's almost always a wait, so plan accordingly. The inside is quite small which means it gets loud quickly, but again it's all worth it. We can't stay away",,,

Seattle, WA","Machiavelli was amazing! It is truly a little Italian treasure on Capitol Hill! I have lived in the neighborhood for a while, but recently decided to try it out and so glad I did!
The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five was the LONG wait. Otherwise, it's a fantastic restaurant! The servers and hostess were all really nice and the food is DELICIOUS. It was definitely some of the greatest Italian food that I have had in Seattle! I really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant as well. Very hip and casual.
Myself and my friend both had the Chicken Parmigiana and we loved it! It was cooked to perfection and had a layer of sauce over it that was amazing! The cheese melted on top was delicious as well, and to top it off the ground parmesan cheese on top of it made it everything! The spaghetti that came as a sodr dish was delicious as well!
For dessert, I had their in-house made vanilla bean cheesecake, which was phenomenal. It had a Graham cracker crust that just melts in your mouth. One of the best tasting cheesecakes I have ever had!
I definitely enjoyed Machiavelli and I will be returning. :) Please note, if you go on a weekend night, please be prepared to wait a while. However, your wait will be worth it! :)",,,

Seattle, WA","TLDR: Amazing food, cheap prices, ridiculously long wait times for both food and a table.
Food: You get a free serving of bread for the table which was fresh and soft, also much needed because the wait for food was really long. We ordered a half carafe of the house wine to drink, the spinach ravioli - which was creamy and well cooked and my ultimate favorite- The chicken liver lasagne. The chicken liver lasagne takes 25 mins to cook and every bite of it is well worth the wait.
Ambience & Service: This is a cozy restaurant with limited seating so the wait times here are incredibly long. I had to wait for more than an hour to get a table for 2. They don't accept phone reservations either. You can chill at the bar while you wait.
Cost: This is where this restaurant won me over. Cost us just 46$ for a dinner for two people that included 2 glasses of wine per person and 2 entrees. This is a very decent price to pay for the quality of food you get here.
My only complaint is the wait times involved. Else this place is awesome!",,,

The Caesar salad with white anchovies was EXCELLENT. Probably the best salad I've ever had, thought it may or may not have been caused by the 1hr wait time. Anyway, the white anchovy add on is a must.
For the main course, I got the chicken liver lasagna. It was delicious, but I also like eating organs (fair warning for those who don't like eating organs normally and want to see if they'd like it. You won't because the distinct flavor was definitely still there).",,,

When we got there, there was a 30-40 mins wait time (on a Tuesday). We were waiting at the bar area and asked the server if we can just order food or appetizers at the bar and she said we can do that. The bartender, however, denied to take our food order or even showing us the menu!
After finally getting the table, we ordered an eggplant parmesan and a penne pasta with red pepper and walnut. They served complementary olive bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette which we loved!
The eggplant parmesan was just ok, it was too cheesy and not as breaded as we like. The pasta was really good and creamy.
The server was nice and attentive. The ambience is old and cosy, with dim lighting. The wait time for food was long. The value for price is good since the portions are big.",,,

The service was incredible from the minute we walked in. Everyone was so friendly.
We ordered the chicken parmigiana and the spinach ravioli. The ravioli was delicious and they didn't skimp on the tomato cream sauce. Pretty delicious. The chicken parmigiana blew our minds! We both decided it was by far THE BEST we have ever had! The sauce was so perfect and the chicken portion was perfect. Usually it's too thick and you loose the flavors eating the chicken.
Last we had the chocolate mousse tiramisu. It was also good. I preferred the moose over the rum dipped lady fingers.
The only slight improvement would be the bread in the beginning (which was complimentary). It was really hard and chewy but really does not matter with everything else being so amazing! Go eat the chicken parm here! You won't regret it!",,,

We have been on a social distance quarantine since the Coronavirus pandemic erupted. I guess other people aren't reading the same research I am. People were out and about, in spite of the rain, and in spite of any contagious virus. The bars on 2nd Avenue were full, including the bar at Tavol脿ta. I felt foolish, locking myself inside all week, but then again, my age is susceptible to complications if I contract the Coronavirus. Foolish, paranoid, overly cautious, vigilant, better safe than sorry; who knows?
The food from Tavol脿ta was good. Our rigatoni and pappardelle pastas were good. The Arancini balls were a bit bland for my taste. Carpaccio was okay. Bread was well baked.

Seattle, WA","Terribly disappointing experience, and had it not been for our waitress, this would be one star. I had made our reservations the day Valentine's Day reservations opened and the menu posted at Tavolata. Despite our early booking, we were seated in the very center of a communal table (that, as I recall, I had specifically requested to avoid). The table was too loud for me and my boyfriend to even speak to each other, so we requested to be moved to another table. Meanwhile there were several other couples at their own tables, including one couple at a 4-top. They sat us at the bar, which was fine.
Once we were seated at the bar, we reviewed the menu. The menu in our hands had almost entirely different courses for the pasta and entree from what Tavolata had posted online and the menu we had so been looking forward to. This was incredibly disappointing and deceptive in my opinion.
Our waitress at the bar was lovely (blonde curly hair and tall). But the servers left dirty plates on our spot for too long (I had to ask them to clear the appetizer plates) and they did not seem appropriately trained. I overheard one server saying it was his third day at the job, and the hosts (we were sitting directly next to them) were cursing and mocking some of the patrons to each other by the end of our dinner.
Also, our ticket for our 2nd and 3rd courses ""got lost."" We waited over 1.5 hours for our pasta course after getting the appetizers. When our waitress told us this, she was apologetic but didn't offer any recourse until I asked her if we could have more wine since we had drank the glass that was supposed to be paired with our course. She was happy to oblige but it was pretty clear all we would have gotten was an apology otherwise. When we finally got our pasta, it was cold.
The food was okay. Porchetta was way too salty with huge salt crystals and peppercorns intact that made a difficult texture to chew. If they had had their promised menu I would have ordered the lobster (by the way, Tavolata, don't promise this as a menu item if you aren't positive you'll get it. We had thought about going to the lobster dinner at Derby but didn't because we saw we would get lobster on this menu. What a waste.) Mushroom ravioli was okay but not what I was looking forward to going into the meal. Port wine pairing was cheap and too sweet. 2.5 hours later we left our meal feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.
I've had quite a few experiences with Tavolata before this, but after being so disappointed with this deceptive and uncomfortable experience, I will never be returning.",,,

We were hoping to get the happy hour deals but the bar was full so we sat at a table. It's a bit annoying that the happy hour is only offered at the bar and not at the tables. If I sat 3 feet away from my table seat my dinner would've been deeply discounted for the same food. Oh well.
Upon being seated, the waiter gave us each a small glass of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary. That was a kind gesture and was appreciated. We ordered some drinks and our meals and waited in anticipation. I ordered the pappardelle and my gf got a carbonara dish. The food was stellar. When it arrived at the table it was one of those dishes that doesn't look like a lot of food until you start eating it. We also ordered the bruschetta with smoked salmon. It was tasty but I'd probably try another appetizer next time.

Tavol脿ta,(206) 838-8008,"Kamara S.
Bellevue, WA","Out of all the Italian restaurants I visited in Seattle, I have to say Tavol脿ta is one of my faves.
I have been to both restaurants multiple times. In fact, once I came an hour early because I thought it opened at an earlier time. Of course, I couldn't show my face for a period of time after that.
This review is for the Belltown location. The people there are friendly as you walked through the door and explain to you that happy hour (5-7 pm) is limited to the long bar in the front and the side table structure at the very front of the restaurant. I say structure because it glides along the window in a weird pattern that is aesthetically interesting to see.
I have to say this restaurant has a great happy hour. I define a good happy hour as one where you could get a decent meal just off of ordering from the happy hour listings alone. You can get cheap but delicious wine options ($6 bubbles don't mind if I do). Good apps to share (if you are into that). Plus actual pasta options like 2 different dishes of spaghetti depending on your interest. Plus I appreciate that they have an actual dessert on the happy hour menu as well.
Myself, like many others before me, have chosen the gnocchi alla romana thinking it would be the small ones we know. I won't call it a mistake because I enjoyed the dish, but I think they can call it out more so people know what to expect.
But the main reason I go back to this restaurant, even if I have to cross from the Eastside is for something that isn't even on the menu and isn't available all the time. It is... their bucatini carbonara. I know this is not the first place I had bucatini but it is a good reason why I love it. It is not even available during happy hour but I keep going back for it (I try other good things as well).
The worst part is the guessing game in which you have to see it if it would be available. I could call ahead to check but even I am not that ridiculous and I can try other dishes when I get there. I have been there once where they were going to have it the day after I ate there. I was crushed. But it is a great #treatyourself meal if it is available.
Would I bring a big group to Tavol脿ta? Not in the winter if you are banking on happy hour. But if we wanted to ball on pasta and other treats, sure. If it was 2-3 people, I would definitely try to get a bar seat. It would be a great and interesting date location.

San Diego, CA","Highly recommend the Pappardelle! Was delicious.
Burrata app, not so much. Their menu changes but it seems they keep different versions of it - when we order it there were figs. Issues were the oddity of the ice cold cheese and rock hard crustinis that are a bit painful to bite into. After enduring for a bit, I decided to ask our server for some fresh bread and that switch helped a bit. If the crustini was a bit thicker cut and more chewy than hard, it would help a lot.
Got 'An appropriate sipper' (bourbon based cocktail) and that was very tasty and enjoyed.
Our table was towards the back along the wall with view into the open kitchen. I always enjoy watching the kitchen prepare meals. Great advertising on their part since it convinced us to get the delicious dessert that was being prepared for a large group. I forgot to take a photo and my memory is fuzzy but since these items change often there isnt much point!
I do appreciate the constantly changing menu; I'm sure this is a popular spot for locals of Seattle. Lovely ambiance, attentive service, delicious italian food.",,,

What puts the cherry on top is the fact that the pasta is made from scratch !! How many places can say that ?? Their happy hour brings plates half off and house wines as well. Employees are very friendly and check in on you often to see if you're doing okay. The reason for the 4 star review is because there isn't much seating space around the bar area... which I believe are the only seats available for Happy Hour menu options (could be mistaken).

Seattle, WA","I really enjoyed having dinner for Seattle Restaurant Week here because they allow you to order anything off of their menu, while most restaurants have a limited menu.
For appetizers, I loved the bruschetta. It was well cooked and the smoked fish was perfect on top. This was probably the only appetizer I enjoyed.
For entrees, we had the rigatoni and the halibut. Right away you can see that the rigatoni comes in a pretty good sized serving. The sauce and meatballs were delicious and had a pleasantly spicy kick to it. I definitely recommend this dish! The halibut was pretty disappointing. It was charred, but a little too charred. Some bites tasted like nothing but char, which was annoying. The rice & sauce that accompanies the halibut was good though. If you're interested in this dish, I'd strongly recommend requesting it to be just lightly charred.
The service here was excellent. Our server gave us a good recommendation for wine and was friendly and attentive all evening long. I've heard that sometimes servers at pricier restaurants can be a little biased against you if you're there for SRW, but they really seem to embrace SRW here.
Overall, Tavolata is not one of my favorites for Italian food but it's still pretty good. Personally, I probably wouldn't come back for anything other than Happy Hour or SRW because there are better affordable options around, but if you decide to come here for dinner it's a solid choice.",,,

It is rather loud in the restaurant. Can we tough to find good parking, so we paid to park in a lot behind the restaurant. The starter bread was good (not out of this world). The spaghetti dish was really good - noodles were thick and delicious and the sauce was light and yummy. The Pappardelle was good - heavy sauce, orange flavor didn't throw me off a ton, and thick noodles. I preferred the spaghetti dish however because the noodles and sauce were better IMO. The chicken and ricotta meatballs were also very good with the spaghetti. Portions are large - we both took some to go. Price is high.

I came to celebrate my friend's birthday recently and the whole experience was amazing! The hostess was super nice and made an exception by letting my two friends sit in the bar area (HH area) before I got there (usually the whole party has to be there). The food tasted amazing at only $12 a plate on the happy hour menu it's a steal!!! They also didn't skimp on the size like I expected for HH and instead the plates were full dinner size. The drink prices were also pretty good with $6 for a well drink and $$4 for a San Juan hard seltzer.
I ordered the spaghetti with chicken ricotta meatballs and I'd give it a 4/5 stars. You can definitely tell the pasta was homemade from the great texture and the sauce was light, but well flavored. I liked the meatballs, but I wish you could taste the ricotta more and that they did 3 slightly smaller meatballs instead of 2 massive ones. I'd definitely order this again! My friend had the Pappardelle and from the one bite I tried I it also tasted really good!

The buttered noodles (called something fancier on the menu) were actually pretty good considering it's a rather basic dish. We shared the donuts for dessert and the chocolate sauce they came with was amazing.",,,

I have been really delighted by my experience here over the last few weeks, which has been made even better with places like this. I ordered a Caesar salad and gnocchi to take with me on my overnight shift. When I stopped to pick up my order (wearing scrubs since I was on my way to work), I was handed my food and my ticket was ripped up. I was really overwhelmed! I have been trying to help local businesses by ordering out as much as possible, but to be recognized for helping during the pandemic is appreciated immensely. The best part? The food was wonderful!

Bikes hang from the ceiling, ""Big eyes"" paintings with a Wes Anderson narrator on a old time stereo greet you in the bathroom, with many other alluring Knick knacks in every corner.
Not only is the ambiance to die for, BUT THE FOOD! Hand rolled pastas with many other on season dishes for a super reasonable price. They have a famous tomato based sauce that is a must taste (My fave thing on their menu is the ""Margarita"" pasta dish)

The place just threw me off completely!
Very small tiny restaurant with corky cute interesting decor.
We got here early around 5:30pm and it was almost full, we took the last 2 seater on the place.
As always, my husband came super prepared, read all the Yelpies' reviews, so he knows what he wants. On the other hand, I just walked in with no clue, so every pasta dish seems yummm.
Our server recommended me to try the Forest Floor Frenzy which is a wild mushroom & walnut parpadelle with cream sherry sauce. This is the most amazing pasta dish I ever have, not exaggerating!! The cream sherry sauce was in a perfect rich creamy consistency coating the think smooth parpadelle. The wild mushrooms had hint of woodiness that might be the sherry sauce amplified must better, and along with the slight crunch of chopped walnuts. I was mmm-ing through every bite.
Then I swapped with my husband's order, the Elk Bolognese. He didn't seem to be too excited about it, but when he passed me his dish, and I took a swift, the aroma captivated me already. The rich sweet peppery smell was making me drool! The elk was pretty lean and not gamey, so blended right in with the pork shoulder. The parpadelle was just the right chew and thinness, amazing!!
I tried the dessert of the day, chevre cheesecake with rosemary graham crust & vanilla olive oil roasted grapes & a black vanilla tea honey sauce. Yeah, you heard me, chevre cheesecake!! It was definitely heavenly! I never had a goat cheesecake before, and I have to say, I'm never a big fan of goat cheese, but I just cannot stop nodding my head and squinting my chinese eyes and giggle! This cheesecake was so delicious!! The goat cheese was on the mild side with some lemon zest or lemon juice blended in that popped in my mouth. I was super happy with the vanilla live oil roasted grapes, taste exactly what it sound, amazingly delicious! It's rare to see olive oil used in dessert so I was very intrigued. Lastly, the black vanilla tea honey sauce had some depth from the tea aroma which blended the cheesecake and rosemary graham crust very well. BEST GOAT CHEESECAKE ever! Even though it was my first
When we left shortly after 6pm, there were at least 3-4 parties waiting outside the restaurant, so do try to come early! Free street parking in the neighborhood, just to make sure not to block someone's driveway
I am still super stoked and savoring all the tastes from this amazing dinner! Already thinking when I can come back!!",,,

Seattle, WA","We're headed back tonight so I guess I should get around to reviewing our last experience!
We arrived around 8 on a Weeknight and I had had a terrible day, it was pouring, we were freezing and tired, and Italian was calling our name.
Welcomed at the front door, they led us back to the ""Best Table in the House"" - a tiny, candlelit table tucked into a little alcove in the back of the restaurant, where the glass table top covers hundreds of little notes left on the back of dinner receipts from others who have sat here.
We always start with Arancini - these are creamy and just the right bit of a bite, crispy and nestled in a little bath of Bizzaro's delicious marinara.
I order the Meatballs, available only on Monday nights. He orders the special - Gnocchi with Italian sausage.
The server is the same woman who has waited on us our last 5 times here - I wish I knew her name so I could give her the recognition she deserves. She's funny, so friendly, and just the right amount of attentive. We love her!
Food arrives - gnocchi is pillowy and rich, slightly chewy, drenched in a delicious, creamy, herb filled cream sauce. The meatballs are tucked into a perfectly cooked pile of pasta - not spaghetti, but a shorter, thicker, rolled tube noodle covered in light and garlicky marinara, and swaddled in a blanket of melted cheese.
We are far enough away from other tables that we
can enjoy the bits of their conversation that we hear, but we are private enough to enjoy our own.
For dessert, we had gelato that came with some pretty cute little friends on top - that I didn't even mind beheading to scoop up a bit of melted gelato.
Bottom line - we didn't need romance but it's impossible not to get swept up in it if you're here with someone you love. We didn't need for anything while we were there because the service is excellent. And we didn't need two boxes for leftovers because the boyfriend ate his whole plate clean.
Please go here. Please keep this place alive. Bizzaros is a gem that should be shined!",,,

Came here on a Monday night just before the prime dinner rush, and thankfully we did. This place was fulllll. Even with two large parties, our server gave us plenty of attention and was so sweet. This restaurant has parking right in front, although only a handful of spots, and has the quirkiest decor.
We ordered the meatballs and spaghetti with starter salad, elk bolognese with onion soup, and the fainting goat gelato for dessert.

After a handful of visits, I think I'm done with Bizzarros cafe. The food quality for the price point just isn't up to snuff. I recently ordered some cacio e peppe - and it was like eating a giant bowl of bland noddles. I would guess that to make that dish a star you need super fresh and spicy pepper along with noodles cooked to perfection. Nope.

We had the arancini to start. The sauce around the arancini was some of the best that I have ever tasted. We also tried the seasonal pumpkin gnocchi with Italian sausage, as well as the wild mushroom parapadelle. Both were very rich, with superb flavor. I can't wait to go back to try the wild elk bolognese, which is their most popular dish. They serve wine casual Italian style, out of rocks glasses.

Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,"Alex O.
Rutherford, NJ","I don't like it. The bread was just not tasty and it felt old & stale. I got the eggplant Parmesan fritters for the appetizer. It was inconsistent. Sometimes it was spicy and sometimes it wasn't. It also felt like an amateur cooked it. Cut slices of eggplant, deep fry it, slather tomato sauce and cheese. Serve. Felt very fast food. The forest floor is basically mushroom sauce and pasta. If you love mushrooms then get this. Otherwise, it has an overwhelming amount of fungi. The sugar snap carbonara was a huge disappointment. Trust me the pasta is not made in house and if it is...it sure doesn't taste like it. It felt over cooked and soggy and reminded me of ramen noodles. Also, the sauce is bland. The reason why people like it is because the bacon and peas have a lot of flavor.
The garlic soup is extra buttery and has cloves of garlic. It was way too extreme for me.
Dessert sucked!! Honestly, if they bought the dessert from an outside source it would have probably tasted better.",,,

What was left was thin and insubstantial- for a 20 dollar pasta dish I expected ALOT more. 4) I will say, their chicken dish was AMAZING. Almost worth overlooking their shortcomings. Almost.

Each entree comes with a fresh salad, with optional upgrade to Caesar salad, spinach salad, or soup. I honestly liked the starter salad the best.
All our dishes felt very high quality. They were well made and their ingredients seemed especially good. My favorite dish was the forest floor frenzy and it's assortment of mushrooms. So tasty.
In conclusion, this would be a great place for a date night. Tasty food, cozy ambiance, unusual decor, and not too loud to have conversation. Watch out though, it's popular and if you go at prime dinner time, you'll need to wait.",,,

Ambience:
You have candle lit tables and an assortment of chandeliers, you also have skeletal brides seated on a carriage hanging off the ceiling. (Not kidding)
Food:
We had the Elk Bolognese: My first time tasting Elk, and for those who are afraid to try it, this tastes very similar to lamb. The pasta and elk were both fantastic. If you are familiar with the Pakistani/Indian dish called ""Kheema"", this was like having Elk Kheema over pasta. Delicious!
We also had the ""I gnocchi what you did last summer"", delicious creamy gnocchi. Those who like blue cheese will love this. It is cooked in a walnut and blue cheese based sauce.
We ended the meal with the Tiramisu for dessert. It was Humungous and delightful to the last bite.
Service & Cost:
The servers are friendly and service is quick. The prices here are not too terrible, cost us ~70 (not including tip) for two people- we had a carafe of wine, two entrees and dessert. Pretty decent for the food & ambience!

If you're looking for a pasta wo cheese, that's a great choice! The mixed salad is as normal as any salad w oil and vinegar. Their tiramisu was so creamy and not too sweet.

Food:
I'm docking off a star because their bread... how do I put it mildly... is pretty bad, it's store bought! I mean it's literally the same as the $2 Trader Joe's bread that I buy. Even the cheapest Italian places have better bread. The garlic oil is decent.
Onto the main course, now this is where they shine. I had the Pesto Penne, and the pesto was super fresh, and just about everything about their main dishes, including the white sauce pasta is good!
Price and Portion:
Portions are hearty, no complaints there. Infact, mind you, the food is like super rich. Your heart will give out if you eat too much. Price is perfect too.

It was kind of cold, so we were planning to say we wanted to sit inside when the server asked us whether we would want to sit inside or outside. But he never asked...LOL he just seated us outside. I'm sure we could have told him we wanted to be seated inside instead, but we just didn't say anything.
Service was alright otherwise. The waiters were pretty nice.
Free bread! It's not as good as the bread at the Cheesecake Factory, but it was alright.
The presentation of all the pasta dishes we got was very nice! The portions are good for the price too. We had leftovers that we took home.
I got the fettucine tartufo ($18) which has Italian sausage, truffle oil, Italian sausage, and cream sauce. It's definitely on the heavy side, but I liked it. I would give it a 4/5. It's super oily though. Kind of felt like I was eating oil.
We also got the spaghetti di mare ($19), and we were impressed with how much seafood it came with. It comes with tiger prawns, mussels and clams, and they were really generous with the amount. And the price wasn't bad at all for a seafood pasta. The garlic flavor wasn't too strong, and this dish wasn't as heavy as the fettucine. This would probably get a 4.5/5!
The spaghetti carbonara ($15) was so good! Also a 4.5/5. But I really love carbonara. It comes with pancetta, and the spaghetti is so creamyyy. I would probably get this one if I went again.",,,

However, everything else was not good. I asked the server his preference between two pasta dishes. He suggested one over the other, so I ordered that. Our salad came out quickly, and then the entrees took forever. We were all very hungry by the time our entrees arrived, about 30+ minutes later. The entree given to me was not what I had ordered. It wasn't even the other pasta dish I had asked about. I told the waiter this and he begrudgingly took the entree away. It was not what I had ordered, why is that my fault? I thought that they would hurry to make the correct entree, but I was wrong. My family finished their meals and then my food was given to me. At this point, I had waited an hour total for my entree. I asked the server for pepper flakes, he never came back with them. I had to ask two more times before they were brought to me.
Then, the receipt came. We were charged for the incorrect entree that they had initially brought out to me. The server seemed extremely annoyed that he had to fix the receipt. They not only tried to charge us more than we should have paid, but did not apologize once, or comp anything for the inconvenience. Not even my $3 soft drink.
A sorry would have gone a long way in this situation, but it never came. The whole time I felt like I was the one at fault. We will not be returning to La Vita E Bella.",,,

The atmosphere was very upbeat pleasant nice to look at maybe it was because of the weather outside but I would definitely take my friends there. if you go order the lasagna and they might even give you some garlic bread and bring your dog but you'll probably have to sit outside I was allowed to sit inside .this place ranks 5 stars restaurant,

The reviews were kind of mixed, but I guess I came on a good night. The wine list was good--I ordered some nice red. For the appetizer I had the Caprese salad--it was really good with nice, fresh tomatoes.
For the main course I had a cheese pizza. I thought it was really good. The crust was nice and thin and I loved the tomato sauce.
I will definitely be back",,,

Seattle, WA","My husband and I ate our Valentine's Day dinner here, and we had a great experience!
We ordered the gnocchi with chicken and the lasagna. The gnocchi is made fresh daily in-house, and it seriously melts in your mouth! So delicious, and the chicken had a nice charbroiled flavor to it. The lasagna was also delicious--great sauce, and I loved the blend of cheeses that they used.
Best of all, the service was amazing. Both servers working at the time made our experience very special. They were attentive, friendly, and our food came out quickly. I also liked the presentation of their aranciata soda!
I would definitely recommend eating at Brunello.",,,

Seattle, WA","This review is for my experience coming here for Valentines Day. They have a set menu for $50 where you choose an appetizer, salad and entree.
7:45: Arrived at the restaurant - promptly seated and given bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
7:50: Made our choices off the menu.
8:20: Got our salad. Tasted decent but portion was pretty small.
8:50: Got our entrees. Filet mignon was really good (but you can't really mess up filet mignon right?)! Seafood linguini was lackluster. Pasta was really soft and seemed like overcooked, packaged pasta.
9:15: We were given tiramisu for our troubles.
9:45: Finally got our appetizers and a slice of lemon cake (as additional compensation) both boxed to go.
Their desserts are amazing and I want to come back on a regular day to try their food. I have no doubt in my mind that they serve great food and have kind staff.
But I felt like I was held hostage here for 2 hours - I didn't want to leave and pay $50 before I got all my (average) food. I understand that it was a busy night but they had a set menu and had a reservation system - I expected better preparation from them. People who were seated after us were getting food before us.
TLDR - 30 minutes for salad, 1 hour for entree, 2 hours for appetizer, yeesh :(",,,
Brunello Ristorante,(206) 527-4778,"Jenny Z.
Seattle, WA","WOW the food here is amazing! Ate the leftovers for lunch today and honestly just as good. We came here for my husband's birthday dinner. I booked through Yelp for the first time and it was quite convenient.
We came on a busy Saturday night for an 8 pm reservation. Even though we came about 10 min early, we got sat right away. We started with a bottle called Marchesi which is a sangio/cab blend (mostly sangio) which was light with main note of cherry. I did wish it had more cab since we like fuller body wines, but the lightness ended up pairing well with our meal.
For apps we ordered the olives, caprese salad and caesar salad. Olives came out hot which I had never had before! It was flavorful and tasted amazing with their bread. The caprese salad was a generous portion and fresh tasting. Caesar was good as well. I added anchovies which were extremely salty...almost cured? I would pass on that next time, especially if you're expecting fresh anchovies like I was.
For dinner I ordered the seafood special. Husband ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola with chicken (after reading the review that the person could die happy after eating it lol). Both were amazing. I personally liked the seafood dish more. Very fresh seafood and perfectly al dente pasta. The gnocchi dish was rich and creamy and the chicken was tossed on top, which cut the creaminess in a good way.
Overall food tasted delicious and authentically Italian and will definitely be back to try more pasta. Next time we will definitely try the carbonara which had raving reviews. I also enjoyed the wine list which offered wines from several Italian regions. It's always nice to try a bottle you can't normally order from a Seattle restaurant. The ambiance was really nice and felt like you were transported to a little Italian restaurant in Trastevere.
The downside for us was the lackluster service, especially for a birthday dinner. Friendly server but forgot several things (forgetting to put in our appetizer order, asking several times whose birthday it was despite me writing it into the notes of the reservation and telling him, asking me to remind about the bday dessert, giving us another table's filled out receipt instead of my card back, etc.)
Just a little bit more thoughtfulness would have made the birthday dinner less chaotic-seeming. Good thing husband does not care all that much about bdays :) All in all a very nice dinner despite the unconventional service lol.",,,

Hinsdale, IL","Led to Brunello by the 4 1/2 star rating. While I was expecting an old style neighborhood Italian restaurant, I was underwhelmed when I walked in. It was a bit more ""rustic"" than I anticipated. Menu was mostly pastas but also had chicken and veal entrees. But this was ideal for the evening as I was looking for pasta along with the Huskies I was feeding. I ordered the only homemade pasta on the menu, the gnocchi with red sauce and meatballs. The gnocchi pillows were really good. However the sauce was way too spicy to my liking and I like heat but in this case it took away from the gnocchi. And the smallish meatbballs were bland. Service was excellent. You can expect a decent meal just don't come with expectations that you'll be blown away which a Yelp rating like it has will do.",,,

The sauce was plentiful and tasty. The gnocchi was on point. If you're in the Roosevelt neighborhood, I would definitely make sure to give this Italian restaurant a try.
Accessibility: This place is accessible. There are no steps to get in nor any booths to worry about. It will be a tight squeeze when it is busy though. The flooring is raised tiles so it may be bumpy for any wheelchair users. I do not remember the washroom situation. I would inquire.",,,

Tim, the owner, had an excellent wine special by the glass that paired perfectly with my starter of meatballs in a hearty marinara sauce. The meatballs were so delectable!
I appreciated the option of more Parmesan, fresh cracked pepper and red chili flakes throughout my meal as I like things a little spicy.
For the next course I had the Pomodoro Caprese and the tomatoes tasted so very fresh! The mozzarella, olive oil, balsamic and basil were top quality which all together made this delicious!
For my main course I had the Carbonara and if you are a fan of this creamy pasta dish with egg and panceta it does not disappoint.
To finish off my meal I had the in house made tiramisu and some limoncello. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.
Tim and his staff have definitely got the right vibe in this Ristorante Italiano with great conversation, fantastic wine and food and a comforting overall ambience. I will be back!",,,

The bread was actually bland but was improved by dipping it in balsamic vinegar and olio. Yet, if their entrees are this delish, then the bread should match the food quality. I highly recommend they try a better recipe or buy better tasting bread. I am a bread fanatic and unwarranted and unofficial bread connoisseur so if I dont like the bread, then the rest of the meal we be subpar automatically.",,,

The menu had a great selection, and the food we ordered was tasty. I had a vegetarian pasta dish and he had a seafood pasta special. The portion size is very generous for the amount of each dish. The wine menu was decent and the service was very good. Our only complaint was that the vanilla gelato tasted more like ice cream than actual gelato, so that was a bit frustrating.",,,

I ordered the pasta special of the night, and got to try a little bite of my friends' pasta dishes. For all the pasta dishes I tried, I think they were good but not particularly amazing.

Seattle, WA","I really want to like this place. It's very convenient with a warm atmosphere, friendly staff and a variety of tasty food options. Both times I've been, the food has been slow to come out but this isn't usually more than a nuisance, especially on busy nights. However, on Saturday night my husband's order was lost/forgotten, and he ended up waiting about 15 minutes longer for his food - a large seafood pasta dish. They were very kind about the mistake and even comped a couple desserts. In hindsight, though, I worry that the staff rushed to make the food in order to address the error, since my husband has had symptoms of food poisoning since the morning after, and undercooked seafood seems a very likely culprit.
Again, I want to like this place, but I don't think we will go back. For those who do go, I recommend the tiramisu and would steer clear of any shellfish.",,,

The food was just okay. I'm from Los Angeles and I was being too harsh comparing it to my favorite Italian restaurant back home. I got the spaghetti bolognese and fettuccini pesto. Both were a bit bland in my opinion. Meatballs were tasty though!

Seattle, WA","I had been at the restaurant that used to be in this location. It was also Italian. That was as much as I can remember about it. Other than that, I don't quite remember how the food or service was.
My husband and I had an impromptu date night. We wanted to go to the Crest, but we wanted to eat out before the movie. I suggested this place because I had a hankering for pasta.
I tend to expect neighborhood joints to be good at best. And that's sometimes okay if you're, like us, hungry and desperate.
Look, I'm not saying this like being in Italy. But the food was pretty good. I generally don't love Italian-American cuisine because it tends to be too cheesy. This place served food that was between Jersey Italian-American and artisanal regional Italian cuisine if that makes sense. Like they at least have the decency not to batter and fry their calamari... But they do have your heavy sauces if you want your pasta that way. We enjoyed our pasta dishes and the service was very warm. It's not the cheapest meal but was quite reasonable everything considered.
For specifics: I'm not sure how I feel about the bread. It's served warm (which was fantastic!) but I just wish it has a little bit more crust and bite. The pasta we had was al dente and the sauces had a pretty good balance. I ordered the penne vodka while my husband ordered the linguini vongole. The penne vodka was good but was missing... Something. I asked for a side of parsley and was given some chiffonade basil lol that actually worked! It just needed a little brightness to balance the heavy creaminess of it. My husband enjoyed his dish but said it was also missing something. It was just a little bit of sauce.
Overall, we would come back.",,,

Seattle, WA","I've come to Tavolata twice now and while the overall experience is passable, my 3 star rating is bc nothing really blew me away. In my most recent visit, I came with a large party (14 people) for my friends birthday dinner. My first of three stars this place gets is for the service - we were able to create a customized tasting menu including appetizers, pasta, entrees, sides, AND dessert for the birthday, with a mix of veg and non-veg options to meet the needs of various people in our party. The waiters were friendly and attentive throughout, and I'll add another star for an ambiance that is good for special occasions with large groups to date vibes or intimate friend group dinners.
The food didn't wow me though - I've had much more memorable Italian in a 5 mile radius of this place. We started with a standard meat board (it's hard to mess that up), burrata that honestly was bland, and fried lard which tasted a bit rubbery and not fresh. The pastas (potato gnocchi and ravioli) were also just ok - the ravioli had a weird honey taste mixed with the savory sauce, and while some cuisines nail the mix of savory and sweet, I don't think Italian pasta is the right place to try it (at least this one). Finally, the pork chop was hard to bite, chew, and swallow - it honestly tasted like a dish you would get at a college dining hall. The farroto (off the menu veg item), as well as the rapini, however, were decent - the garlic/lemon zest on the rapini was a nice palette cleanse from the pasta and the farroto was a solid veg risotto. My third star is for those dishes. Finally, the lemon donut dessert was fine, but again, better donuts and dessert options within a 5 min walk from here (cue Salt & Straw, General Purpose, and Frankie & Joes).
If you do end up coming here for some reason, ask for the Farroto and rapini and it'll satisfy your taste buds while enjoying the vibrant ambiance. I wouldn't waste your calorie intake or $$ on anything else from here.",,,

Seattle, WA","My friend and I were exploring Capitol Hill and happened upon Tavolata and we were both pleasantly surprised! It happened to be 15 min before happy hour ended and the barista took our orders in just in time. One thing I will say is I do not think I would be as happy paying full price for what we got, which is why it is 3.5 stars.
We ordered the arugula salad, bruschetta, spaghetti, and rosemary gimlets. The arugula salad was crisp, cheesy, and lemon-y exactly what you're looking when consuming a bitter salad. It was actually my favorite part of the meal 炉\_(銉?_/炉 The spaghetti was a little too anchovy-y which I found odd since I was searching for the salt and pepper shakers... the meatballs were good but the flavor was lacking. The pasta appeared to be fresh pasta but was just a tad too al dente. My friend and I both agreed within our first bite that it should've had more time in the hot water, but the parm shavings were a nice touch. The bruschetta did not come had we not asked about it, which was fine with us since we were working on our other choices, but I had to ask for that. But it was sourdough bread with a very unique dip and a side of olive oil and balsamic.
Sitting at the bar made me realize how tricky it must be to multitask all the aspects of a full menu and drinks for the whole restaurant. The gal at the bar handled it like a champ. The rosemary gimlet was actually one of the most memorable! Refreshing, perfect amount of rosemary taste and citrus and relatively strong on the gin, which is an excellent balance. Our bill was $30 each with tip which I thought was still on the higher end for what we got.
All in all, I would perhaps try it again if I were coerced into it but I don't know if the pasta made that much of an impression to me to come back. I've had better pasta elsewhere, maybe I just didn't order the right thing?",,,

But the star is the spreadable cheese -it will blow your mind how flavorful it is. They didn't have any specials that night, so I played it safe with spaghetti & meatballs. But goodness gracious this is nothing like what you can make at home, and that's the whole fun of eating out. It's covered in a pile of parmesan with sturdy, firm noodles and it's SO good. Run, don't walk to this one. Slightly dim lighting so you might think it's a romantic date spot, but it's kind of loud on the inside, unless you're lucky enough to get a quiet corner somewhere.

We made reservations for 6 on Monday and got seated right away. I was interested in their happy hour menu as well and they were able to accommodate us for the bar area.
The menu was awesome for SRW - you get to choose an appetizer, entree and dessert on their regular menu!
- Brussels sprouts - filling, good texture, a little bland
-albacore with mussles - interesting, the albacore was thick cut and cooked medium rare. It was bland but went well with the mussles and sauce
-sorbetto - ice cream went well with the cookie, but wasn't sure where the sweet and salty came from as both was sweet. The ice cream was coconut lime and was good.
The HH menu was also awesome!
-bruschetta - fish was good and was a lot on the crunchy/soft bread. Flavor was spot on.
-parpadelle - favorite meat sauce, and the pasta was cooked perfectly
Price and portion for both menu was generous and I would definitely come back! Service was ok, not particularly amazing but better than what I expected. This is probably one of the best SRW restaurant Ive been to.",,,

My favorite from the happy hour menu is the rigatoni with spicy sausage. Delicious, makes me want to get more every time. The gnocchi is also decent, no complaints.
The chicken ravioli is super bomb, I definitely recommend this dish (not on HH). At first I thought this dish was small but was filling even though I was super hungry.
Bruschetta with smoked fish - the fish is amazing! Tasted very fresh. I just wish the bread was a little softer. It was a little too crunchy to our liking but still a solid appetizer. I also tried the olive appetizer before but didn't really enjoy it.
I've only gone here for dinner and the wait for the food is pretty long. Service is okay nothing spectacular. I would suggest making reservation to avoid long lines for the weekend since it can get pretty busy or if you want to sit at the booth.",,,

The steak tartare was good, but almost too cold. I had the spaghetti with anchovy off the happy hour menu and it was the highlight. My wife had the tagliatelle with scallops, and she hated it. Scallops were diced up and the Alfredo type of sauce was off. It was honestly inedible but we were told it was a new add to the menu and delicious. It's also one of, if not the most expensive pasta on the menu.

It was a rainy Sunday evening and the restaurant was not too full when we came in for our reservation.
We each order our own dishes and I got to try some of my friend's dishes as well. Everything was very well plated and delicious (al dente)!!
Food:
Pappardelle - My friend and I split the Pappardelle and the spaghetti. I like the pappardelle more because it was a meat sauce and I haven't had an anchovy sauce before on my pasta. Both pastas were perfectly al dente and a pretty sizeable portion.
Anchovy Spaghetti with side meatballs - Meatballs were delicious! The spaghetti was a bit more fishy than I expected, but I liked the pasta overall. It was just more overpowering than I thought.
My friends all seemed very happy with their pasta dishes (also the salumi board was excellent). We all pretty much cleaned up all of the food somehow. I think the bucatini might have been a clear winner of the pastas though.

My colleaguefriend is Indian and somehow picky with her food intake.
Myself, I am in ketosis mode and with bad mood for cutting bread from my diet plus all that sugar...therefore irritable. Tavolata saved our night. My colleaguefriend enjoyed her pasta (al dente, not hard! ) and I definitively went fully keto, with that halibut in romesco sauce and shared an octopus carpaccio mega delicious with her. Also, had an non alcoholic cocktail that was so good you forgot it has no alcohol in it.

The roasted beets were my favorite starter. The gnocchi is one of my favorite pastas on the menu- chewy and lightly bouncy texture, and the sauce tastes fresh and zesty. The pastas all are sharable too, so you'd be able to get a little bit of everything. Also, the Porchetta is great- maybe a little extra with the salt, but overall, the pork tasted good with all the accompaniments on the wood board.

The novelty factor at Tavol谩ta is high, beginning with super-spicy Calabrian spice roasted pistachios and ending with hazelnut chocolate topped with the bitterest grapefruit marmalade you'll ever have. Get it while you can, when I tried asking for the marmalade's source they told me it's only temporarily on the menu.
And of course, if the start and the end are so good, how could they falter on the middle course? Main entre茅 was a cheesy sumptuous semolina ravioli delight, the Gnocchi alla Romana.

~~Appetizers~~
Bruschetta: Perfectly crisped bread paired with rich and smoky salmon. The blend of savory salmon and aioli with sour pickled onion on top of their bread was too good to resist.
Burrata: The burrata was even tastier than the bruschetta. The cheese was just so fresh and delicious. This was my first time having burrata, so I don't know how it compares.
~~Main~~
Rigatoni: Slightly spicy with very rich sausage. It was topped heartily with shaved cheese. The pasta had the perfect amount of chew, and soaked in the tomato sauce quite well.
Pappardelle: This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The pappardelle was perfect. Everything from the meat to the sauce was done perfectly. A+ dish.
~~Dessert~~
Sorbetto: Mango sorbetto was too sour. This would be okay if there were more sweet things in the dish to balance it out. Alas, the shortbread cookie was too little.
Buttermilk Panna Cotta: AMAZING dessert. Super creamy and creative to use ""sweetened"" rhubarb to top it off.
Tavolata really hit a home run with the pappardelle and panna cotta. Our waiter was really nice and took time to talk to us about the dishes.",,,

North Bend, WA","We checked this place out for Seattle's restaurant week and loved the vibe. The area of Seattle its in is a bit tough for parking so I spent about 40 mins looking for street parking on a Sunday during the dinner hour. I was definitely approaching hangry state after it taking that long to get parked so I was super excited to enjoy some wine and snackas.
We had reservations and were seated quickly in a nice booth overlooking the street. Loved the design of the restaurant with wood and black accents and hanging bulb industrial lighting. The restaurant week menu was extensive and had lots of options for $35. There were plenty of gluten free options for me to indulge in and diffuse my hangry state with including gf pasta!
I had the burrata with a delicious rhubarb agrodolce that was beautifully served on a wood plank with bits of bright green garnish. It was a great flavor profile and I really enjoyed the complexity of the rhubarb. Ooobviously I was forced to ruin my diet with gf pasta because..well..they had it available. I selected the orecchiette with gf penne substituted. I absolutely loved the nettle pesto and it was delicious with the mushrooms. The last course was the only option I could have and that was the panna cotta. I wasn't crazy about this one.
Our service was good but we definitely spent some time waiting scanning for our server wanting to order our second glass of wine. Overall though, we were definitely impressed with the menu and will be returning to further explore it.",,,

Got an appetizer (salumi board), an entree (opted for the confit chicken instead of pasta since I always get pasta here), and dessert (panna cotta). Loved every single thing as usual!
I was also introduced to the Zeppole (lemon donuts with powdered sugar that you dip into a chocolate sauce) which was AMAZING. GAH. Next time I head to Tavolata I'm definitely ordering that for dessert.",,,

Seattle, WA","Il Nido is a cozy little nook in West Seattle with very respectable hospitality and cuisine.
We started with the light and fluffy house-made focaccia, the surprising bit was that the olive oil they served it with was perfectly light, fruity, and grassy. It's the little details like this that tells that the kitchen really knows what they're doing.
The beet pasta with pistachio pesto was my favorite dish of the night. Perfectly cooked, fresh made pasta coated in a peppery and minty pesto. For our third course we got crispy smashed potatoes that were covered in rosemary and malt vinegar powder, it was served with a perfectly balanced horseradish sauce. Also, we ordered the steelhead trout which was perfectly cooked and served in a tomato paprika broth.
Dessert was a tiramisu with a fantastically oversized pizzelle on top, and a bright berry pavlova.
The host was warm and welcoming and took a few minutes to chat with us during our dessert and gave us some great local food tips. Our server was friendly and did a great job of explaining the menu. The decor stays true to the historical log cabin structure which is pretty much a historical artifact in modern day West Seattle.
Ten out of ten, would come again.",,,

Seattle, WA","Great ambiance walking into this place. The host was incredibly welcoming (and handsome). We sat down and the server promptly greeted us to ask about drinks (so important). He ended up being very helpful in selecting a reasonably priced bottle of wine that paired very well with our entire meal, which is not an easy task.
The burrata and prosciutto to start was next-level amazing. Wow. It seemed a bit pricey, but after experiencing it, it all made sense and was totally worth it.
As expected, the pasta was on point and excellent.
We didn't know if we should get the regular sized bistecca or the portion for 2. The regular size was the perfect amount. The steak was cooked perfectly and quality meat. It's a personal preference that I wish it would have had a more pronounced and charred crust. But nice flavors coming through nonetheless.
For everything that we got and the quality of this food experience, I am very impressed with how they keep this at such a relatively reasonable price point (just like Il Corvo, where they could obviously charge more if they wanted to). Well done. Assuming I can get another reservation, I will be coming back.",,,

Seattle, WA","So very glad this outstanding restaurant has settled into the historic Homestead Cabin just off Alki Beach.
We've had three meals now, no easy feat given the intense demand for reservations since they opened last summer. They all were among the very best we've had in Seattle. The pasta dishes change frequently and are all beautifully textured and popping with fresh fresh flavors, perfectly sauced. The antipasto are mostly light and bright; I have no idea how they source such extraordinary ingredients in the dead of winter. And the primi & secondi are all prepared so perfectly (so far) - the ribeye with a light, crispy crust containing stunning fatty bursts with each bite - the lamb beautifully prepared with the most delicately fruity/minty sauce - the black cod or salmon also beautifully sauced.
Service is elegantly casual, and the selection of wine is wonderful. Cocktails are also so well prepared.
I have no idea how this place is rated only 4 stars - this place is of the caliber of Salare, Cafe Juanita, and Canlis.",,,

Seattle, WA","We were able to snag last minutes reservations for two on the Resy site on the day of (there was a cancellation!) at 8pm. We've been wanting to eat at Il Nido for months since it opened. The Resy site was easy to use and we got an email confirmation plus a text reminder an hour before our reservation.
We arrived a few minutes early (there's a small parking lot but we easily found street parking - Alki in winter is a lot less busy) and the host seated us right away. The historic Alki Homestead building has been beautifully restored. The interior is gorgeous and because it's December there were Christmas decorations which was lovely.
Our server Chad came over and told us the special (which was a cheese plate) and gave us some time to look over the menu. Everything on the menu sounded good. We decided on the special cheese plate (which came with a soft cheese from Cowgirl Creamery), the sage pappardelle in rabbit sugo, and the cider braised pork cheek. We asked the server to recommend a wine to go with our dinner and he suggested the arneis.
The arneis wine was lovely and paired well with our food. The cheese plate was yummy - the cheese was good and the housemade quince paste was delicious. Our pasta dish was my favorite part of the meal. The sage pappardelle was amazing and cooked perfectly. The rabbit meat was tender (and plentiful) and the sauce was light tasty. The pork cheek was also delicious and the flavor was great and the meat was also really tender (didn't even need a knife!). This polenta cake came with the pork cheek and that was super salty. Not sure if they just added too much salt or they added enough salt but didn't account for the polenta soaking up additional sauce, but it was way too salty.
Overall, the meal was delicious - the pasta and the proteins were good and the service was excellent, and the ambiance was perfect. I loved the log cabin interior and the christmas decorations. The only reason I couldn't give a full five stars was because of the overly salty polenta cake. For the prices and for the difficulty of getting reservations, I would expect all the food to be perfect. I'll definitely come back for the pasta (if we can somehow get reservations again)!",,,

Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,"Marie B.
Shoreline, WA","I am behind in my Yelp reviews coming up on one year, however, despite that sleep eludes me, I am compelled to post a Yelp review for Il Nido (10/9/19).
Big fan of pretty much whatever project Chef Mike Easton, his wife Victoria, and their team are involved in....from the early days of Bizarro, Lecosho, and when Il Corvo was sharing space with a gelato shop at the Pike Place Market Hillclimb. Well before those infamous weekday lines on James between 2nd and 3rd Avenues.
Since I'm a northender and work way up in North Lynnwood for 4.5 years, it is rare to have that amazing bowl of pasta, that kale salad, the proscuitto/pickled celery plate, selection of olives, and/or the delicious shortbread cookies from Il Corvo.
There are plenty of other worthy sites all over the city, but with traffic, parking, budget, and other logistics, sometimes having amazing hand crafted pasta takes major strategic planning.
I was among the masses awaiting the restoration of the Alki Homestead and the opening of Il Nido. Wasn't among the first to dine in mid May though and regretfully had to cancel a reservation in June. Then to learn it's booked a month or so out, are you f-ing kidding me?
Spring and summer flies by. Autumn is well underway with the colorful foliage and brisk breeze.
On a whim, turned my attention to the Resy site yesterday to see if I can nail a unicorn reservation to Il Nido. I literally had to blink in disbelief at six available slots for today. Time to check it out, and see why Yelp reviews run the entire spectrum, and why the wide disparity?
I left my home with a two hour cushion to make that trek to West Seattle. Not bad, in 30 minutes I was exiting off the bridge onto Harbor Avenue. Beautiful views of the water and the downtown Seattle skyline, I periodically stopped to admire and photograph. Located Il Nido (see posted tip) and a parking space right out front, then basked in the sun.
They don't unlock the main entrance until 5pm sharp. So I had an opportunity to admire the building exterior and well kept garden beds, plus chat with a trio of other women seated at the front bench. More folks also started appearing on the porch. Nice and orderly we all entered, thankfully no Black Friday-like pushing and shoving.
Once inside taking it all in, very aesthetically pleasing, and an amazing interior restoration. I had a brief flashback to two Willows Inn visits with the similarities of welcoming warmth, natural light, and lots of focal points.
Checked in at the host stand and was promptly brought to a two top, where I was taken care of by Chad and his other Il Nido colleagues. I was pleased to learn that the seasonal menu recently had changed, but passed on this evening's special of rabbit. ""Thumper"" at Cafe Juanita nearly two decades ago still gives me PTSD.
So here's the run down of what I indulged in:
*Rubicon ($14) Bourbon, black walnut bitters, fig sugar, on the rocks. Nice strong and smooth cocktail.
*Contorni ($11) Mixed chicories salad with anchovy dressing, perfectly soft boiled egg, and copious parmigiano atop. Wish the greens weren't quite so cold temperature wise, but ate about a third with the egg. Kindly the rest was boxed up.
*Primi Pasta ($24) Lumache, winter squash cream, crisp fried sage, and cookie dust. Delicious seasonal pasta. This is where others balk at either the pasta prices, quantity, or both. I ate half with all the sage leaves. Again, kindly the rest was boxed up.
*Secondi Bistecca Ribeye ($49) requested medium rare and served atop tender salad greens. The juices on the greens were spot on tasty. I was blown away by the quality, preparation, and presentation of the ribeye steak. Perfectly seasoned, juicy, tender...barely didn't need the steak knife provided. Again, ate half with all the salad greens. Yes, another box filled.
*Savored the ribeye with a glass of 2016 Avennia Gravura ($16/glass) a full bodied Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc from Columbia Valley. The pour definitely complemented the steak.
*For dessert, Espresso with biscotti ($3) and the Chocolate Salami dessert special ($10) added the exclamation point to my dinner. Slices of chocolate speckled with ladyfingers to mimic the salami, served in addition with hazelnut brittle, plum and apple slices, and a berry compote. Nicely composed, not cloying, and terrific flavors and textures.
I enjoyed my brief exchanges with the wait staff throughout my meal and the host staff upon departing. I dined alone, but was well attended to and the entire meal was well paced.
Il Nido is an impressive neighborhood gem, fresh seasonal items showcased from local purveyors, spot on professional service, contributing to an overall, thoroughly enjoyable dining experience.",,,
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,"Huong L.
Renton, WA","I was super excited about this place when i first heard about it. I even woke up at like 3am to try to get reservations... I guess my expectation was too high that it was kind of a let down...
The place itself is very rustic and homey so it was a mix between being casual and fancy.
As you get seated, your server comes over to explain the menu as it change frequently, which is nice. We ended up getting following:
the special of the day which is a papadel noodle with a rabbit ragu - the pasta here is the same as il corvo - perfectly cooked, great flavors, but 2-3x more expensive than il corvo...
the quail wrapped with bacon - this was a very well balanced dish, the quail wrapped in bacon was cooked perfectly, and it was savory and rich, which was balanced out by some vibrant greens and plums.
braised green dish - did not expect this dish to be so southern style. It was kinda heavy and more beans than braised green, also kinda bland.
Poached pear in red wine with crumble - pretty good. You get a nice surprise when you cut the pear open as it is filled with cream. Also very light and not super sweet.
In summary, the food was ok, some good, some ok, but nothing extraordinary. The pasta was perfect but I rather wait at il corvo as it is cheaper and you can get more options. The wait for food here was almost as long which confuse me because they have an idea of how many people will be here through reservation so I don't know why it took so long for food to come out (it took almost 30 minutes for our dessert!)
The highlight of my meal??? The little biscotti sample they gave at the very end. It was probably the best biscotti I ever eaten. But they gave us 1.5 bitr pieces for 2 people...not sure what that is about either ..",,,

Bellevue, WA","Great atmosphere, good service & delicious food! I'm a fan!
Everything we tried here was very good but the only thing that was a little disappointing was the portion was a bit lacking compared to other Italian restaurants, especially because it is on the pricier side.
We got the Castelvetrano Foccacia Bread to start off (unfortunately, bread does not come with the meal hahah) but man, it was worth paying for it because it was delicious.
We also tried the Rigatoni Nero & the Wild Boar Tagliatelle. The tagliatelle was cooked to perfection! It was so good - I think this was my favorite dish! The Rigatoni Nero lacked sauce - the pasta was a bit dry, but I did like that there was a lot of octopus in the dish. The Wood-grilled Saddle of Lamb was really yummy but it was pretty small! Haha I must have been super hungry. We finished our meal with Tiramisu dessert! My all time favorite and it did not disappoint!
Overall, I would definitely recommend everyone to try this place at least once! I will definitely come back for special occasions - IF we can get a reservation! They book out months in advance... We got super lucky and came here on the week of their opening because my friend ending up giving me her reservation! :) Thanks Il Nido - we had a great experience here.",,,

I am a huge fan of il corvo so of course when I heard about il nido opening up, I desperately needed to try it! The menu seemed to have rotated recently so I have the updated menu below!
For starters we ordered the chicories salad and bruschetta al lardo. Both were absolutely delicious! Fair warning, the chicories salad was pretty bitter so if you don't like bitter tastes don't get it! The bruschetta was sooo good. The bread was very fresh & the butter was so creamy!
For pastas, we ordered the rigatoni with braiseed beef & the bucatini with pork. The pasta was cooked very al dente just like how they do it over at il corvo. The beef sauce was pretty heavy and packed full of flavors. There were big beef chunks in it too! The bucatini had little pork pieces and was definitely a lot less strong but still very flavorful as well. I'm glad I was able to have a little of both for some balance. The pasta portions were the same as il corvo's!
For dessert we had the tiramisu which was pretty good (nothing special though!)",,,

Seattle, WA","Went here for opening night with high expectations. I knew the pasta was going to be great, but I had one question... is it worth it? Yes. The service was great. Our server actually engaged with us about the menu rather than just telling us ""the special"" and the usual ""thanks for joining us"".
Small menu but, the dishes were well executed.
The octopus rigatoni was 5/5!! A heaping portion of baby octopus, pasta and oh man- the spices. I try not order squid, octopus or even scallops at restaurants because it tends to be over cooked, but I'm really glad I gave it a go! Also tried the trout. The olives and the fennel really enhanced the flavor of the fish.
Then came the tiramisu. It wasn't as ""soaked"" as I would've liked, which made the flavor more like just any other ""coffee cake"". I wasn't so sure about the chocolate garnish because it just ended up bigger than the actual tiramisu... was it supposed to be a shell? I'm not sure.
All in all, it was good food. The ocean view near by isn't so bad either.",,,

Getting reservations are tough (1 month in advance and opens at midnight). Once you dine there the hostess will ask if you want to make more reservations so we made 2 more 3-4 months in advance. I thought this was a really nice touch making them value their customers!

Reservations: Seriously prohibitive and a pain. Reservations are open 30 days at a time. Reservations open at midnight. Had to book a month out at 12:01 am.
Parking: There's a lot right next door to the building. Signs will say parking for Homestead only; that's for Il Nido at the Homestead.
Burrata and prosciutto: Burrata was incredibly fresh and light, prosciutto was beautifully delicate and perfectly salty paired with the fresh burrata. Hands down the best prosciutto I've ever had.
Tagliatelle with bolognese: Tagliatelle was a little more al dente than I've had at other places; I loved the chew. I hate to compare it to Il Corvo, but how do you not? I also haven't been to Il Corvo for a couple years now because the line is impossible now. Based on my v distant memory, Il Corvo was just as good for half the price. But since I can't get Il Corvo anymore, then I'll pay for chef's pasta at Il Nido.
Cauliflower steak: it was fine. Gorgonzola was an interesting pairing that I've never had before. Gorgonzola wasn't overwhelming, but it was too much for me. That's a very personal taste thing though.
Pork cheeks with dried pear slices and polenta: Pork cheeks were didnt-need-a-fork tender. The sweetness of the pear complemented the earthiness of the pork cheeks. The polenta was the best I ever had. Crispy on the outside, fluffy soft the inside. Nice cheese flavor without being cheesy.
Would def come back!",,,
Il Nido,(206) 466-6265,"Emily J.
Kirkland, WA","When the reservations opened for Il Nido, I immediately jumped on resy to book for a weekend night. Looking back on it, I am glad I did because when I was debating moving it, all the reservations for June were taken.
Having been to Il Corvo one time before, I kinda knew what I was getting myself into by going here. If you are unfamiliar with their style, which I assume you aren't since you are on their yelp page, you now know what type of menu they have and what their dishes look like.
The prices are not low. I would not come here on a budget or thinking you are going to get quantity or quality. You are going here for the quality.
Reviewing the menu, each dish seems thoughtfully put together and you can see that in the presentation as each of your items gets placed onto your table.
For my date night, we started off with a drink. I asked for a fruity suggestion and ended up ordering the Cool Waves. It was definitely fruity, somewhat strong, and very tasty.
For the appetizer, we ordered the burrata and the 24 month prosciutto. If you have never had a burrata before, it is a fresh Italian milk cheese. When you see it, you probably are thinking rich and dense but it is actually what I would consider light, clean, and subtle. A very delicate flavor in my opinion. If you cannot handle dairy or are not a fan of milk, maybe skip it, otherwise I would recommend. The prosciutto was kinda gamey? A unique taste and little on the salty side.
The main course items we chose were the ricotta cavatieddi, roman style pomodoro and the wood grilled saddle lamb, corona beans, charred spring onions, peas. I, obviously, chose the pasta. It was exactly what I was expecting. Really good and I could of ate a huge portion of it. It was the perfect size if you had an appetizer before. If you did not, you would probably consider it small. The wood grilled saddle lamb was delicious. It melt in your mouth and had great flavor. The beans on the other hand, were just okay.
Overall, the meal was good but pricey. If you need to eat a ton, be ready to open up your wallet. Would I go back? Definitely! But only if other people wanted to go.
Parking - They do have a few spaces on the left, if you are driving by and facing the restaurant. They seem like they are normally open if you have either the 5pm or 5:30 pm reservation. If you have a later reservation, fingers crossed that you get a spot or else you get the joy of driving around alkai looking for street parking.",,,

Seattle, WA","I cannot believe how difficult it was to get reservations here... I literally had to check back almost every day to see if anyone had cancelled and it still took a couple weeks. In the end we had a great experience and the food was delicious, but definitely on the pricier side for West Seattle. That said, given how busy this place is, I think there is plenty of demand for a littler pricier dining in West Seattle. I mean, how many more pizza places do we need?
We ordered a bottle of wine, two drinks, two pastas, burrata & 24 month prosciutto, focaccia, lamb, and tiramisu, and that was plenty and bit overkill for the two of us. But if you wait for that long to try a place, you might as well try as much as you can. I think our bill ended up being $260 including tip, so I would put it on the special occasion list or a couple times a year list. There are some lower priced Italian options in West Seattle that offer some pretty decent handmade pasta as well, but this place seemed like a level above and the service was really good.
Overall, will definitely be back to try it out again once things have died down a bit and reservations are easier.
Note- there is a bar which I assume is walk-up and you can order off their main menu, but can't confirm. There were a limited number of seats at the bar, maybe 8-10",,,

Seattle, WA","I'll preface this by saying it's more like 3.5*
We've been waiting for this place to open up seeing how much we loved Il Corvo, but tough to make it there only during lunches.
With Il Nido open for dinner, we can have more of a chance to have delicious pasta.
First off the building, decor was welcoming like a home and service was on point from the greet to sit down. Our server was honest about the food and gave suggestions about what he thought were the stars and which dishes might needs to be tweaked.
We had the bruschetta, king oyster mushroom, and two different pasta and a couple of drinks.
The bruschetta came with a lard spread that was delicious but the bread was so burnt, they actually took it off our bill and gave us focaccia bread.
The mushroom dish was a great appetizer with right amount of saltiness and earthiness. This restored my thought that it's going to be a great meal.
However, when the two pasta dish came out it was a tale of two pasta. The gemelli sauce was great but the pasta itself a bit overcooked and fell apart. The cavadetti texture was perfect but sauce could have used a bit more salt. Some small changes would have made them perfect like I'm used at at Il Corvo. Also, the portions were on a smaller side even for fine dining.
Overall, they just opened not so long ago so hopefully they work out the small missteps by the time we dine there again.",,,

This restaurant is in a really hidden location (it's the right most business in the plaza) and there's no well lit/big sign at all in the front to help you locate the restaurant as you drive here. But note that the small parking lot IS available to park at when you eat here!
We ordered the Bruschetta to start - lovely! It contained lots of tomatoes so that was a very pleasant start. For dinner, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara and my husband ordered the Lasagna. When you order your entrees....order one between two people. Don't say I didn't warn you!! The portion size is GINORMOUS (see pics) and you definitely want to leave room for dessert. Unless you want lots of leftovers (I mean that is not a bad thing), then split an entree. :P The actual entrees were absolutely DELICIOUS. For dessert, we ordered the Canoli - light and YUMMY!! We were disappointed there wasn't Panna Cotta on the dessert menu but we got over that pretty quickly. :P

Our food took slightly longer than they said it would, which was understandable since the phone kept ringing with people placing orders.
The food was good... I highly recommend their farro salad. It was delicious! The arancini were good and a decent size - just not my favorite dish. The marinara that came with them had good seasoning. Porky's pizza was good - with a fluffy crust (again, good - just not a favorite.) The Basilico pasta was great... it wasn't as warm when I got home, but still tasty.

Redmond, WA","Didn't like the food or service here. Have had Italian in multiple restaurants over the years, but this was by far one of the worst experiences in dining I've had. A girlfriend and I went here for dinner. At first the waiter was very polite and courteous and brought back our drinks and appetizer promptly. The appetizer was okay- I was eager to try out their entrees based on all the great reviews I had read about the place. I asked if they had a mushroom/veg risotto as I really love risotto but only a seafood risotto was on their menu. They obliged even though it wasn't on the menu. The outcome however, was a bad excuse for risotto with 3 mushrooms on it for garnishing. The texture, taste and consistency of the dish was just bad.
When I told the waiter that it was pretty bland, he offered me some seasoning. I was pretty sure that no amount of pepper and chili flakes was going to help that dish, it was just too bad but I did try anyway.
I asked if he could bring me another entree at which he snapped and said- I asked for mushroom risotto and so I should eat it and that he can't keep switching my entrees till I like one. Needless to say, I lost my appetite then n there.
At the end, when the check came- he didn't charge for the risotto. However, that was too little too late for me and I most definitely wouldn't be returning here.",,,

The chicken Marsala was more bland than we like. We both felt the chicken Parmesan was very good and would go back for that again. Meatballs and spaghetti was a meal we would order again too.
Don't forget the garlic knots are great!",,,

She makes everything in house and wonderful! Higher recommend the Lamb Ragout sandwich, the lunch menu is small, but they have a much larger menu for dinner that starts at 4pm. Lunch is from 11:am- 2:00pm, get there early as it is a small restaurant but very nice.",,,

Seattle, WA","Came here last Friday with a friend and we indulged in the ""Family Style"" meal, where you choose what you pay (suggested $20-50 pp) and the chef curates a multi-course dinner for the table. Per our server's recommendation, we did $35 to bring us from appetizer to dessert, and this was no joke best $35 I've ever spent at a restaurant!! The quantity and quality of food served here would have easily been $60+ pp at other restaurants. So happy I've found this hidden gem!! Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great value, authentic Italian comfort food.
More on the food:
- Appetizer (5/5...peep my photo to see the full spread!!): A few of my favorites were the caesar salad w/ crab meat, steamed clams in white wine, deep fried gnocchi, tomatoes & burrata, and toasted baguette w/ this amaaazing pistachio spread. I probably could've been full off just the first course! But of course, I paced myself in anticipation for the other dishes... :)
- Pesto tortellini with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes (5/5): This was easily the most decadent and well-made tortellini I've ever had! The pasta itself had the perfect amount of bite/chewiness, the pesto was so fresh/aromatic, and the creamy goat cheese + the sweet-tartness of the sun-dried tomato made every bite taste like a little piece of heaven. I'm typically not blown away by tortellini but this dish packed so much flavor!
- Steak w/ roasted asparagus (4/5): The steak cut like butter and the asparagus was perfectly roasted and seasoned...it was a simple dish but was cooked really well and complemented the bold flavors in our other courses. Dessert:
- Cheesecake w/ chocolate salami (4/5): Loved how the cheesecake was so fluffy/light! Also enjoyed nibbling on the salami-shaped dark chocolates pieces with walnuts.
Our server was super helpful and friendly -- he consistently went out of his way to make sure we were enjoying our food and our water cups were never empty. The restaurant itself is modestly sized and modestly decorated...the ambiance is nothing to write home about, but the incredible food, service, and value made Aglio E Olio a 5/5 experience for me!",,,

You would never notice it from the street view and when you walk in you're immediately thinking ""wait? really? this place does good italian food?"" It is a quintessential hole in the wall restaurant without any bells and whistles on ambiance but the food and service far exceed expectations! Portions are large and the price points are hard to beat. The farro salad is massive and has huge chunks of goat cheese. Quite tasty! The arancini are hearty and topped with plenty of tomato sauce. The harvest gnocchi was divine! Rich, cheesy but still a nice light pasta dish. Our server was lovely as well and the food came out rather quick! I can't wait to return!",,,

What a surprise. Our son wanted to have birthday dinner here, so the five of us went on a Saturday evening.
FOOD: 4.5 stars. We had $35 per person dinner, leaving the chef to decide the contents. This included for the vegan among us. Excellent value. Several appetizers (green salad, cold cuts, olives, mozzarella, bruschetta, artichokes, etc), pasta meat dish, lamb chops (and equivalents for the vegan). Followed by dessert. The bday boy received a free tiramisu - heavenly; the rest of us had chocolate gelato with fruit - excellent!
We also had a carafe of house red wine from Montepulciano.
SERVICE: 5.0 stars. The gentleman and lady servers worked hard to ensure we were very satisfied.
AMBIANCE: 4.0 stars. Nicely done, attractive (yet simple) interior.
TIP: Make reservations, at least for a Sat evening. They were fully booked the evening we dined. Quite a few people came in for take-out.",,,

Aglio e Olio, however, I found randomly when I decided I needed a bite to eat and was in the area. It's a small intimate restaurant and I was thinking: ""Sigh, whatever. At least I can just get pasta or something.""
Wow. This place has hands down my favorite meatballs I've ever had in my entire life. They're huge, and they taste AMAZING. I've been going back more frequently now, and I also have to recommend the Calamari. It's not deep-fried, it's not crispy, but instead it's this AMAZING pan-seared quality. Please, please, please do yourself a favor and try the Calamari. Ridiculously good!
Anyways. I didn't realize I was coming into a wonderful small family-style and family-tasting Italian restaurant until I tasted the food, and at that point I realized I was in a good place.

It was only a dinner thing but he agreed to it and said '35 will bring you through dessert is that okay?"". It was a little pricey for lunch and my friend couldn't eat any pork or beef but -spoiler alert- it was well worth the money.
Our first course was an antipasto variety of burrata, fried gnocchi, anchovies, pickled vegis, crab salad , bruschetta and vongole clams. Everything was super tasty and I especially enjoyed the burrata and fried gnocchi.
Our main course was a full serving of halibut over lemon risotto and a pesto pasta with assorted vegis. Could've used a little more salt but it was still good. We couldn't finish the entrees despite coming hungry.
For dessert we had chocolate salami with nuts and fresh berries. And no there was no meat in this salami.
Overall all this food at any other restaurant could've cost well over 100$. It's minus a star because the atmosphere was small and could be improved and the service a little slow.",,,

Seattle, WA","I finally had the chance to eat at Carrello and was very pleased. It is from the owners of Altura (which is also outstanding), and while it does not have that same romantic vibe of Altura, the food is equally excellent.
I was here for Valentine's weekend and the had a set menu of three courses and then a dessert cart came by. Before the first course, they brought by this small tasting dish featuring fish that was outstanding (I would have loved a larger dish). What was interesting was that this food was delivered on this cute little cart.
I read in some other reviews that the service was not great, but I found it really excellent. They were very attentive.
For the first course, I had the chicory salad. This featured watermelon radish and grapefruit and was really unique tasting and really good. I also tasted the parmesan budino and that was great as well.
The second course was pasta and no surprise it was incredible. I had some ravioli that was stuffed with prawns and was a little spicy. It was so delicious, the pasta was so fresh and every bit was perfect. I also tried the gnocchi and that was also excellent (with super truffles on top).
The third course was steak with mashed potatoes topped with these interesting onion strips. The steak was seared perfectly and the potatoes were the perfect compliment. I also tasted the sole that was very fresh and equally tasted.
To finish, the dessert cart dropped several small bites which are fun to eat. My favorite was a hazelnut semifreddo, although a carmel candy was great also.
We arrived early to try to sit at the bar--but was told told there were separate reservations for that (which make dropping in more difficult). I will definitely be back and cannot wait to try more pasta.",,,

Kirkland, WA","The wait staff isn't properly trained in good customer service. We had questions on their beers since they have a good lengthy list of beers-some unique but the server had no idea on the different types of beers. We also had questions on some of the italian names of the dishes and again, the server didn't know either what the menu items were. We complained about our food being very salty and there was never a ""so sorry to hear that"" or even ""is there anything else we can get for you"" or ""let me check on the kitchen about the salt"" ...nothing! When dessert came, there was never a ""would you like some coffee or a after dinner beverage we can get you?"". This is basic customer service and for them to not even get that right is a disappointment. The front of the house just do not seem to care.
The food is just okay. Nothing special and like other reviewers, the best thing here are the bread rolls.",,,

Seattle, WA","5 stars for the pasta. Wow. I did not find the people working here to be ""pretentious"" like other people are saying. The service was perfectly fine and friendly. The reason that I give this 4 stars is because the cart thing is confusing. It made it difficult for me to plan out what we were going to order (wine and additional items off of the menu) because I had no idea what would be included with the cart. We assumed that we would order a lot from the cart and a few pastas. But we didn't end up responding to most of the cart items. So after one other person and I ate two pasta dishes, we were still hungry and unsure of what to do. The meat dishes take a long time to prepare, and you need to order them right away, so that wasn't really an option. With minimal options, we ordered a 3rd pasta. The first two pastas came out immediately and the third pasta took a while. I'm glad we ordered the 3rd pasta, which was a spaghetti, because it was amazing. And then as we were finishing up our meal, new staff came out on carts which was not available during the first part of our meal, and we totally would have picked if we weren't full from pasta number 3.
We ordered a cookie thing with Nutella for dessert. It was good.
I will definitely come back and essentially ignore whatever this cart thing is. It's like a bonus but not integral to the meal. For a table of 2, I will order 2 pastas and a ""For the Table"", which I'm expecting to be excellent. If I come back and the ""For the Table"" course is not excellent, then I will change my Yelp review. However, the pasta is absolutely incredible.",,,

Bellevue, WA","Dinner with my husband tonight and we came here for the first time. Carrello made for a wonderful evening with a great setting and a great feel!
What is unique about their restaurant is the small plates they serve via rolling carts. We had heard about these and being a fan of trying many dishes, we came not knowing if you could make a dinner of these small offerings or not.
They offered about 10 small dishes throughout the time we were here and we had about 7 of them. They were all wonderful but they were small (some only $3-4 each but ranged to $11) and not enough to make a dinner. So we ordered a salad, a pasta and a fish (whole branzino) from the main menu as well. This was the perfect amount of food as the main menu dishes were small also. Total bill before tip was about $135.
Food was fantastic, loved it all. Pasta had a wonderful texture, but it was a small dish size as well. We had so many things that it is difficult to name them all. Fun place to go, especially if you like to try many things instead of one single entree.",,,
Carrello,(206) 257-5622,"Elizabeth L.
Seattle, WA","Tasty pasta, limited menu selection, $$$-$$$$. With its Altura lineage, the pasta at Carrello is delicious - absolutely recommend the agnolotti, pappardelle with oxtail, tripe, anchovy crumb, and gnocchi, all which were divine. We also enjoyed the spicy pan roasted brassicas (broccolini, cauliflower), despite the steep price at $17 for a veggie side.
Aside from the limited menu, Carrello features an Italian take on dimsum with small plates being offered on carts. The roasted beets were tasty but otherwise average, the lamb meatball similarly so. While we enjoyed the prosciutto, the portion was rather miniscule. Would pass on the cured veal. According to our server, roughly 14 snacks and small plates are offered on carts each night.
In full disclosure, we avoided the From the Table meat entrees, which were steeply priced - $59 for roasted whole fish, $125 for dry aged ribeye (would expect 4-star steakhouse at that price), $47 for whole roasted chicken, $59 for roasted lamb neck (wow!).
Portions are small, as reviews note, so prepare to spend $60-$70 pp. Highly recommend cocktails and pasta if you're curious about the Carrello experience!",,,
Carrello,(206) 257-5622,"Sheryl K.
Seattle, WA","Recently tried this place and I can't wait to go back and try more things!
The concept of the restaurant is really similar to dim sum where people come around with carts of food and mark off what you select on a note card. However, this experience was probably a lot better than going to a dim sum restaurant because they don't pressure you and push you to buy food! I guess you can say it's Italian cuisine with the dim sum cart concept.
I can't remember what we picked up from the carts and what we ordered through our server, but everything was very delicious. My only negative comment is that some dishes were pretty spicy but I'm super weak sauce with spicy food. So if you're a normal person that can handle mildly spicy to pretty hot foods, you'd love it. My entree had a slight kick, which was ok-ish for me. I would've preferred no kick/no spice at all, but that's just me. But ate all of it because it was that tasty!
So if you're looking for an Italian restaurant that has a fun ordering experience, I highly recommend coming to try this place out. I'm definitely ready to come back and try more!",,,

Each cart has a number on there which represents the price of the item. Then they mark on the small sheet of paper on your table of what you get (like how dim sum works).

Such a cool concept - you can order a bunch of food from a menu - large meat plates, pasta and apps.., and while waiting or eating, there are carts w/ smaller tapas size portions being pushed around that you can also order off of (imagine dim sum but make it italian). These range from $3-$12 and is super fun to supplement your main meal!
We also had some great wine - they do have a sommelier if you need additional help/recs to pair the right wine with your meal!
One of our group members was vegetarian, and although they don't have a ton of veg specific items, most menu items can be made vegetarian with fantastic substitutes, where it didn't feel like a substitution/customized dish!
Everything we tried was delicious - from the apps, to small plates to pasta... great flavors and honestly afterwards made me excited for my next visit!!!",,,

We heard from friends that the pasta is the way to go here, so we ordered three pastas - their gnocchi, agnolotti and chittara - and then ordered a few things from the different small plate carts.
The verdict - not only was the pasta SO good but the carts made it a really fun experience as well. Not to mention these small plates were VERY decently priced. For example, we got two plates of prosciutto and coppa for $3 EACH.
We really, really loved this place and would definitely want to come back again. I think the prices were just fine for the quality and experience.",,,

Los Angeles, CA","I came across Carello when walking past it looking for a place to eat in the area. They have an interesting concept that I really appreciated. You order your entrees (larger and for the table to share--can take 40-60 mins) plus smaller dishes. They have carts going around throughout the evening with smaller bites you can share. They place a card on your table with number on it and and this number corresponds to the numbers on the cards with the small bites as well as the price of that particular item. Items on the carts vary daily.
We weren't too hungry so we got the beef and veal spaghetti, the brassicas (cauliflower mix), and bread and picked up fried artichoke hearts from one of the carts. I loves the spaghetti. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce was on point. Not overly spicy, but very flavorful. The brassicas were on the spicy wide, but more like too many spices were used as opposed to hotness. It was a little overwhelming. We also munched on some bread which is served with olive oil and butter as an appetizer. The artichoke hearts were also delicious.
Overall, I had a great experience here and loved the food. The plates they have for the table did seem a bit overpriced for what they were though. Pastas and smaller sides were more reasonable.",,,

I've already been a big fan of Altura for a while, naturally I'd have to check out their new venture too. This place came up rather fast for a new spot. The old place closed down, chef Nathan took over! And viola! It's a whole new spot!
The menu was simple enough. Carts of items with prices on it: like dim sum but Italian style. Rabbit meatball, grilled octopus, hamachi crudo, grilled peppers, desserts etc. You pick what you want. And contorni/ salads/bread, pasta and meat/seafood. Meat and seafood dish take about 45-60 minutes to come out so order accordingly.
We had the octopus with lentil, chicory salad, grano with crab and rock shrimp, tagliatelle with anchovy oil and tonno (tuna heart). And the rosemary lemonade and red wine!
The octopus was amazing and delicious. Tiny bite sizes, spicy pepper. Just great. Pasta portions are much smaller than small portions. The tagliatelle was delicious: even had some kale in it? The grano sauce was good but pasta itself was undercooked. We like al dente in our Italian family but this was much undercooked. Would've been great to try a better cooked version.
The chicory was a ok as well. Overall, I was just excited to be here and trying the new concept from my old favorite spot. Cart concept was good but once you missed a cart, it took forever to come back. Some don't even come back. We missed the octopus first time around and got it almost an hour later. Since it's a cart item, you can't order it. Same with mussels. And dessert!
Our server was super friendly. Took about 35-40 minutes to get our bill and pay though. They got busy at the end, it got slow. Same with the carts: once you miss one, it takes forever to get it back since they remake it. . I'm a small eater and left hungry. Overall, 3.5 stars for opening night.

Luckily for Carrello, my girlfriend convinced me to go to this place with her for our anniversary because she really liked the decorations (hanging plants bring the ladies in apparently). We were very impressed by the ambiance and the friendly service. You definitely get the chic hipster vibe when you're in here, so make sure you wear your finest beanie.
This place combines incredible pasta with a mini surprise dish at every turn. They give you a wooden block which signifies to the wait staff if you're in the mood for some Italian delicacies. As you're waiting for your dishes, they bring around all sorts of goodies from calamari, to fancy meatballs, or a massive tray of desserts.
The pasta itself made me want to kiss an Italian grandmother. We took the risk of getting a dish with tripe in it for the first time ever, and it paid off. I can't even remember what the name of the pasta was, but the blend of tripe and veal was so rich and creamy that I forgot I was eating a baby animals and stomach lining.",,,
Carrello,(206) 257-5622,"Grace C.
Pioneer Square, Seattle, WA","This is the pasta place that tried too hard and failed. Tl;dr- get the bread. The pasta is just normal pasta dishes with fancy additions that miss the mark completely.
To start we ordered the bread, potatoes and carrots to share. Two items off the dim sum carts. We each ordered our own pasta- I ordered the tagliatelle for myself.
The homemade bread for $8 is no joke. This is the best bread ever. It's soft and squishy in the middle and the crust has this crunch that is so delicious- it might be the only time I enjoyed the crust more than the inside. The bread alone is 5/5 stars and I am coming back for the bread.
The potatoes were nice- better than the carrots. The potatoes seemed to be double fried and has their own mayo and a sea of sage but so good. The carrots were ok- there's a little bit of bacon in the ocean that is peanuts and it has a tinge of sweetness that was kind of weird.
Off the dim sum cart we got a fried dough and some of the charcuterie- each $4 and not worth it. The fried dough was weird and bland. And to have the charcuterie wrapped around it (as suggested) did not enhance anything for me except the lament that I was down $8.
And the tagliatelle. What's disappointment. It looks nice in the pics- trust me- but it's topped with a giant mount of tuna in hopes to differentiate it from the normal spaghetti aglio e olio. The waiter recommended I mix in the tuna to make it less fishy but then I basically was eating an overly oily aglio e olio. Binging with babish would be disappointed with the amount of olive oil left over.
In short. Not coming back except for the wine and bread. The third star is for the bread.",,,

Seattle, WA","After dining at Altura recently, I was more than happy to find out about Carrello. We decided to come here for an anniversary celebration and the experience didn't disappoint! I've been to one other restaurant (that's not dim sum) that also specializes in traveling carts of food, but the first Italian one.
As for the food, you start with ordering the non-cart items (but if you're like us, we decided to pick a few small items from the carts as it came by first).
+PUMPKIN: We decided to order a contorni (vegetable side dish) and we were so happy to go with this one. The incredibly soft and almost creamy pumpkin (kind of reminded me of sweet potatoes) came topped with hazelnut butter and crispy guanciale! It was the perfect sweet and salty dish! Just to note, my boyfriend doesn't like pumpkin but this might've been one of our favorite dishes here!
-PARSNIP GNOCCHI: I think I just wasn't expecting this one. It's not quite a fluffy gnocchi (maybe because it's made of parsnip?) and came with bits of boar.
-GRANO ARSO RAVIOLI: This was the crab ravioli (came with 3). For this one, I also wasn't used to the pasta dough - it didn't really have the chewiness I normally like in pasta. It was almost stiff. But the broth it came with was deliciously light!
Of these menu items, I think I'd be hesitant to order more of the pasta - they weren't necessarily bad, just not my favorite pasta texture.
As for the cart items, I have to say that I'm the type of person that loves tapas and small dishes, so we definitely focused more on these. The cart items range from $3 upward and each cart has 2-3 items. For dessert, you tell them that you're done with the meal and someone will come out with a cart of all the dessert options!
+DUCK MOUSSE: This was definitely my favorite but I'm a sucker for liver mousses. Oh, and also the crackers were fried in duck fat - no biggie! The dish also came with cranberries on top (loved the tartness to cut the fat).
+BEEF CRUDO: Just so good. The cracker actually reminded us of the exact same crackers from Altura!
+FRIED DOUGH: Okay, can you really go wrong with fried dough? It was only $3, greatly seasoned and went amazingly with the salami.
+SALAMI: Delicious! A pretty good portion that you can also see them slicing in the middle of the restaurant!
+CELERY SALAD WITH ANCHOVY: This looks and sounds so simple but it was delicious! Don't skip out on it!
+LIMONCELLO SEMIFREDDO: Didn't really taste like limoncello to me but it was scrumptious nonetheless! The berries on the bottom were great too!
All in all, I think you get the Altura flavors without the high price tag (though I wouldn't say this is a cheap meal - though worth it!). The service is great and the staff are incredibly friendly! All in all, would definitely return!",,,

Seattle, WA","Service was definitely off. We got there 15 mins early and they made us wait until exactly 7:30 before we were seated, and they had a number of empty tables. They had a number of carts going around with apps/small plates, but half of the carts just went by our table and they didn't even tell us about what was on it. And we were looking at the servers directly since we were hungry.
When we finally did get our first item, no one had stopped by our table to even take a drink order. Which was a shame because I would have liked a glass of wine with the cured meats we got.
Food was delicious, we ordered 2 vegetable dishes and 3 pastas and enjoyed them all immensely. Unfortunately they were all brought them to us all at the same time. All 5 plates for a small table of 2. So we barely had enough room to fit it all in. And then we had to eat really quickly before the food got cold. We each got a glass of red which went wonderfully with each dish we got. Also the fork they give you has kind of wierd dimensions? Made it really difficult to use at times to cut items, as knives were not given.
Hoping these things improve, the food was delicious. When we did interact with the wait staff they we're very friendly.",,,
Carrello,(206) 257-5622,"Kevin Z.
Seattle, WA","Dining at a higher price point (which typically means small portions) can be a fantastic experience when done right. Carrello simply had too many misses for me to be a worthwhile experience for how much it cost.
We started with some bread and fried potatoes. This was the best course of the meal. The bread had a lovely char and was accompanied by some warm butter. Biting into the buttered bread was like crispy heaven. The potatoes were also crispy and well cooked, though the cooks went a little too crazy on the fried sage.
We then got a bunch of pasta to share, many of which had crispy fish flakes on top. While I understand that adding fish flakes or fish sauce can add a lot of umami to a dish, there was simply too much on our pasta which made it taste really fishy and unappetizing. I personally ordered the tagliatelle with tripe. Pasta was cooked well but I felt that the texture of the tripe really ruined the dish. The weird dim sum carts kept coming around the whole time. We ordered some small dishes but weren't really that impressed.
Overall I think I won't be returning for a second meal. The food was only OK and the atmosphere felt unnecessarily pretentious.",,,

Seattle, WA","Carrello, I am constantly forgetting the name, was too much fun. The food was good too! We sat at the liquor bar to eat and immediately struck up conversations with the patrons and the engaging bartender named Firenze. My wife, the true foodie, ordered the food while I gabbed and posed. The pastas were fantastic as was everything else I ate. We ordered too much, as is our wont, and everything tasted wonderful. Everyone at Carrello was smiling, and this is a happy place to be.
The mother restaurant to Carrello is just across the street named Altura. It is a gastronomic destination with an expensive degustation menu. Carrello is the perfect counterpart, with its casual, boisterous vibe. Prices were reasonable but the experience made money irrelevant. A great time is priceless.",,,
Carrello,(206) 257-5622,"Vijay B.
Seattle, WA","Nathan Lockwood is, without a doubt, Seattle's best chef and his first restaurant - Altura - is Seattle's best restaurant. Here's my review for Altura:
yelp.com/biz/altura-seat鈥?If you don't know the history, Altura used to be mostly a la carte. Eventually Lockwood switched to a prixe fixe menu to showcase his culinary talents (which, if Michelin ever came to Seattle, would be amply rewarded) but that had a downside. Many of the favorite a la carte menu items were jettisoned much to the chagrin of his regular patrons. When this was brought up with Lockwood, he mentioned that he had a project in mind to create a second restaurant that would reprise these great dishes (especially the exquisite pasta dishes).
It was several years in the making and having found a perfect location, just across the street from Altura in the old Poppy space, Lockwood has opened Carrello to much fanfare. In a way Carrello feels like the old Altura in a larger space, with some extra quirks. The menu features the amazing pasta dishes that old patrons of Altura had grown to know and love but he has also added a sort of Italian dim-sum quality to the service.
Servers will periodically bring around carts with various delictations concocted by Lockwood, such as duck liver mousse from which diners can choose, if they wish, a taste. In this way Carrello allows diners to have both the a la carte experience with something of a tasting menu feel.
It goes without saying, the food is exceptional. One would expect nothing less from Lockwood, and the space is quite nice. It doesn't quite have the homey feel that Altura does and is a little spartan (I hope in time they can spruce it up a bit), but it's certainly a nice place for a lovely dinner with that special someone.
If you love high end northern italian cuisine, you must try Carrello.",,,

Houston, TX","I have to align with Kevin Z who nailed it in his review below. Unnecessarily pretentious waitstaff ruined what could've been a really great experience. the space is lovely and in a beautiful part of Capitol Hill.
The initial service is fantastic and the bread is to die for, however the pasta was overcooked, salad overdressed and the wait staff less than friendly.
Dessert yielded the worst semi Freddo ever. The cart concept is fantastic but fails to deliver on the food and ultimately provided an overall mediocre experience at a high cost.
I will not be returning here again.",,,

Mercer Island, WA","Two words: Happy Hour.
They have the best HH with so much on their menu at a great price. We loved everything we ordered - which was A LOT:
1) Grilled calamari - 5/5. Tender and flavorful.
2) Grilled octopus - 4/5. I loved the squid so this came in second, but still good! One of my friends liked this better than the squid.
3) Prosciutto w/burrata - 5/5. Delicious and a good portion.
4) Salumi board - 5/5. Good variety.
5) Margherita pizza - 5/5. Light and crispy crust, lots of cheese. Would've liked more basil. Will ask for extra next time.
6) Oysters on the half shell - 5/5. Fresh and served with horse radish, which I love.
7) Beets - 4/5. Simple. Nothing special, but good.
I've also had their mussels when they are in season - later spring. DELICIOUS when they get it from Taylor's Shellfish Farms and they are plump and juicy.
I can't wait to go back for the food. The white wine on HH wasn't great, but we were there for the food, anyway!",,,

Anaheim, CA","We came here for a late lunch and had a large table in the back for 12 people or so. The restaurant was a bit hard to find because you park in the structure parking and come up on street level, but don't see the restaurant. You have to walk around the corner to get to it, so it was a little adventure finding it since there were many restaurants around there.
The food was absolutely delicious! We loved everything we ordered, especially the squid appetizer (to die for!), prosciutto with burrata, oysters, and beef carpaccio. The oysters didn't have any cocktail sauce, only vinegarette, so it wasn't as good as other places. The lack of cocktail sauce was a little disappointing. We ordered a second squid appetizer, but she said they were out (at 2pm already??) but suggested we try the octopus appetizer instead. We said ok and it never came out. I didn't realize this until we left that we never got the octopus dish! We also ordered squid ink pasta, margarita pizza, shrimp carbonara, and a ton of other dishes. Everything was really good, food-wise. Great portions; not too much food, but also not too little.
Service, on the other hand, was JUST OK. Our waitress seemed to forget about us a lot (maybe because we were in the back away from everyone?). When we needed something, we had to wait a long time to finally signal her over. We also asked for group pictures and she told us to hold on and she ran off for awhile. We kept waiting for her to come back... what seemed like forever. She seemed uninterested in taking photos for us. Then, she came back, took a few, and we realized they were dark and needed flash. The next time she came by, we asked if she could kindly retake the photos again, and she said ran off again telling us to ""hold on"" and left. Again, she seemed uninterested or too busy.
It was a late lunch around 2-3pm, so it wasn't prime time and was not that busy in the restaurant. It seemed hardly anyone was there and we were the biggest table. I think it took 15 minutes or more before she came back. Asking for dessert and the check/bill took forever also. Our entire lunch took about 3 hrs or more! We prob spent a good hour or more just waiting for her in-between orders and things. It didn't seem like the waitress was very friendly or interested in helping us at all. She was nice, but service was subpar. Minus 1 star.",,,

I do wish there was one more vegetarian / vegan option on the menu, or that the menu outlined which items were vegetarian. However, as soon as you let their team know, they are on top of it and ensure it is created with your preferences / needs in mind.
Drinks are also great, and they immediately hit you with some housemade bread and oil - yummm.

Honestly, I was about to walk out until this person walked in (coming on to her shift) and started helping me right away. Once we were seated, the service was much better.
My friend and I decided to go with pizzas. The pizzas are a good individual size that you could either eat individually or have leftovers to take home.
I went with the ""Carne,"" which is basically sausage, mushrooms, and cheese. What I liked about it was it was rather light and not oily at all. Everything tasted very fresh. However, nothing stood out from a flavor standpoint. I think this would be much better if they used a spicy sauce with the ingredients to give it a little more bite. You could tell that the ingredients were quality, and the price point wasn't bad for what you get.",,,

They bake their bread in the oven every day and their bread is also amazing. I rarely compliment pasta so this is a real deal for me. They have good soup and salad. Tiramis霉 was good, though Calabria's tiramis霉 is better. Cinque Terre's Tiramis霉 is a bit too sweet to my taste. The wine selection can be better and their ambiance is a bit too dim, tho I get that's the hip thing to do. I would love it if their menu expanded.

Most recently, booked this place for a team lunch and everyone really enjoyed their meals (including the vegetarians!). They have something on the menu to satisfy any type of craving/dietary restrictions -- from housemade pastas/pizzas to a variety of seafoods and steaks.
I ordered their seafood salad which was loaded with fresh prawns, octopus, squid, and clams. Very generous portions and fresh flavors!

Tonight eggplant Parmesan was the special. The chef prepared a plate of thinly sliced eggplant layered with mozzarella and fresh basil. Heavenly is the best way to describe my meal.
Topped it off with tiramisu (lady fingers soaked in coffee and amaretto). Probably the best I have ever tasted. It was not too sweet and just the perfect portion.

Seattle, WA","Went there with my dad just to try their famous seafood soup and was not disappointed! They will split the soup for you if they know you are sharing, which is nice and convenient.
Each soup has a variety of seafood and the amount is decent for 20ish bucks/person. I really like the bread they put into the soup as not every restaurant does that and I particularly like the texture of bread after it was soaked in the soup and absorbed all the juice. They also gave you free baguette so you can dip the bread in the soup even more. However the soup does get cold pretty quickly and that can affect its taste and the dining experience.
We didn't order anything else and I was satisfied after eating. I think one appetizer + the soup will definitely make two people full, or just the soup itself might also be fine depending on your appetite.

The mushrooms on the pizza were sufficient; however I thought it needed to be seasoned more since it was lacking in flavour.

I had the appetizer size of the pulpo (octopus) and the waitress was very nice in warning me that it really is a snack size of 5 bites, and I appreciated the warning! So I fully knew what I was in for but it was still a bit surprising to see the plate in front of me. It was a dressed up single mini tentacle for $14.

We had the sweet potato gnocchi as an appetizer to share. It was good but very small portion. For the main meal I had the clam linguine which was good but again, portion was small, the clams were teeny tiny, and barely any linguine underneath. I was left feeling HUNGRY (hangry).
My boyfriend ordered the ribeye with ""porcini potatoes"". He loves porcini mushrooms but was disappointed that there wasn't even a trace of porcini on the plate. The ribeye was good though.
We wanted to ask our waiter about the ""porcini potatoes"" but he never bothered to ask how our meal was. He walked by our table many times and never stopped to check on us at all! He only talked to us when he brought us the check- which included a service charge before taxes. For adding a service charge, this place did not deliver to a higher standard of service.

We went for lunch on a Friday and while they were full, they were able to seat us in the bar. Service was prompt and friendly. We were almost immediately served four slices of soft bread with olive oil for dipping.
We ordered two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc, and I ordered the agnolotti and my co-worker ordered risotto. The food came out remarkably fast, and the agnolotti - OMG! YUM! At first, the use of lemon was a little overpowering in this creamy dish, but when paired with the cheese inside of the pasta, it was balanced very nicely.

Several items on the menu have butter, cheese, cream or crema sauces ... it's okay to good-naturedly say we want to change things up. Gotta be honest, it was a bit of a bummer interaction.
The sweet potato gnocchi used to be pillow soft but has been overworked and a bit tougher/gummier the last 2 times I've ordered it (the executive chef at Marco Canora's Hearth in NYC taught me how to make gnocchi and it's easy to overwork the potato dough).

Tulio,(206) 624-5500,"Kathryn S.
Henderson, NV","Perhaps it is true that familiarity breeds contempt because, after our first breakfast at Tulio, I would have given Tulio a 4. But we ate four breakfasts here as well as three dinners. It's now down to a 3; meaning, average.
Let me start by stating that not one waitress (breakfast) or waiter (dinner), or the Bartender, introduced themselves. We asked one waiter (Shawn) his name; and we asked the Bartender (Leah) her name. No one told us their names.
I do like the Matre D. On one occasion, he told us which three tables he had available and let us chose. Another evening, he set a professional basketball player and her friend next to us. That was kind of cool.
The restaurant is pleasantly dark, lots of wood, very traditional and warm. Love the interior. However, getting in and out of the booths (which we did twice at breakfast) is hard; especially getting out of them. We then started asking for a table for breakfast. We had stuff to spread out, literature for planning our day. Even though four-tops were available, we were always seated at two-tops which didn't give us room to plan our day.
First breakfast: Hubby had the Waffle with fresh fruit, syrup, a compote and whipped cream. He doesn't like compote or whipped cream; he wants syrup on his Waffle. It's Italian syrup, so way too sweet for his taste. Several days later, I ordered the Waffle and used the compote which I loved as well as a wee bit of whipped cream, which was delicious. In my case, I also ordered bacon, ""crispy, please."" The bacon was prepared ""crispy,"" as I had asked.
First breakfast: I had the Frittata which was topped with dollops of Goat Cheese. It was good. The OJ is $5. I guess that is typical of restaurants but the first breakfast was the first and last time we ordered juice. After that, we swallowed our pills with water. I never have more than a few swallows of coffee, so I brought my own coffee in from the Hotel Lobby. Why pay $5 for half a cup of coffee?
Speaking of water: It is served without asking in all of the Seattle restaurants we visited; and, of course, served without straws. I have a problem with that, because I don't believe that all restaurants get their glasses germ-free; I don't believe the water gets hot enough to sanitize. Just saying.
Second breakfast: My husband wasn't very hungry, so he ordered the Cinnamon Roll. It wasn't warm and the icing had congealed. I had the Waffle and bacon and was very happy.
Third breakfast: We knew we would be out in the wet and rain all day, so we both had Oatmeal. I was surprised it wasn't served with milk. The next day, I ordered Oatmeal again. Different waitress; this one offered milk. We split a Fruit Plate.
Fourth breakfast: By now we were so tired of their limited breakfast menu, we could scream. Fortunately, I rode the elevator with a hotel guest who was carrying two cups of coffee in a tray and a bag of pastries. The next morning, we walked just one block to Vovito where we had tasty, warm Turkey & Cheese Croissant Sandwiches and good coffee. We spent $20 on breakfast at Vovito's instead of $40 at Tulio.
Tulio adds a 5% surcharge to their bills. Hubby didn't notice it when he paid for our first breakfast. I noticed it later. After that, I took care of the bills. I tipped 15% consistently, instead of 20%. In Seattle, check your restaurant bills to see if you're being charged any or all of the gratuity. We dined at two restaurants that add 20% BUT they are clear about it, and say that the wait staff do not expect more. Tulio is sneakier. They make it sound as if it's in accordance with a law to provide a higher minimum wage, but that actually isn't the case at all.
First dinner: We shared the Gnocchi appetizer. The Gnocchis are stuft with Sweet Potatoes and then lightly pan-fried. They were surprisingly good. I had Linguini with Clams. Couldn't see any linguini because there were so many clams. I did eventually get down to the Linguini, at which time I requested cheese. They don't shave the cheese at your table; they spoon already shredded cheese onto your food upon request.
Second dinner: Bartender Leah is great at her job. One evening we just sat at the bar. We wanted some food to soak up the liquor but found their Appetizer Menu to be sorely lacking. When I told Leah there was nothing on it that suited, she offered to put together an antipasto plate. We accepted. We had drinks, the antipasto plate and one slice of Tiramisu. Our bill came to $145!!! Yikes!
Third dinner: My husband had Mussells and thoroughly enjoyed them; the best Mussels he's ever had. I had Pumpkin Soup. It was okay. I've had better. (Five Spice Pumpkin Soup at the historic Panamonte Inn in Boquete, Panam谩.)
Dinners are served with Foccacia, but the bread is bland bland bland. We eat Foccacia at home frequently, but what we buy from Trader Joe's is tasty. This was so bland that it was ""one and done.""",,,

The herb bread was awesome. For drinks, I ordered the lavender Lemon Tini. It was delicious. For food, I ordered the prosciutto wrapped asparagus as an appetizer and orecchiette for entree. The white asparagus and duck egg was an adventure. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The pasta was simple yet comforting. I especially loved the spicy Italian sausage.
Nothing too crazy. Just a good time. Probably not worth a special trip into town. But if you are close by, why not.",,,

Really really unenjoyable. I kept putting salt on it to try and bring out some flavor but there was really nothing to work with. Very little sauce, dry pork belly.

We realized the hotel had given us a $25 discount on a meal there and we were just too tired to go out anywhere else. What a pleasant surprise! The place was cozy and felt very intimate. The service was outstanding and so friendly. The unexpected star for our trip and standout meal. I started with the sweet potato gnocchi, amazing. For dinner I had the roasted chicken with lemon risotto, very good but a tad salty. Still the chicken was cooked perfect. My husband had the ribeye, which he really enjoyed. He also had the local flight of whiskey. He enjoyed that as well.
If I could have, I would give 4.5 stars. Pretty close to perfection had my dinner not been on the salty side....and I even like and usually add salt to my dishes, so if I think it's salty, it's pretty salty.",,,

I enjoyed the mixed greens with gorgonzola and the mussels before sharing the butternut squash soup (delicioso!) and linguini and clams. The linguini was a little too al dente for my taste as I couldn't get the noodles to stay wrapped around my fork but the sauce was flavorful and delicious. I will have to return for the pumpkin gelato in the future as I was out of room and needing to head to the theatre at the end of the meal. Looking forward to it! Service was wonderful!",,,

Seattle, WA","Delightful. Cozy and intimate, with excellent service. The location is quite special - right across from tiny Weather Watch Park in West Seattle, with its breathtaking, glorious views.
The lamb shank special was ""to die for"" according to my friend who ordered it (I don't eat meat). My penne puttanesca was spicy and bracing and packed with flavor. We shared bruschetta and a caprese salad that featured superbly fresh, amazing mozzarella (although the tomatoes were a bit pallid... I blame the time of year). A couple of our party ordered pizzas. One pronounced his ""just fine"" and the other (my husband) thought his was flavorful, but ""too bready."" He's from NYC, so he likes a verrrry thin crust.
Dessert was amazing: the four of us shared a regular and a limoncello tiramisu. Both were HUGE. Both were tender and fluffy and delightful, and neither were cloyingly sweet. The flavor of the liqueur and cream shone through.
WARNING: do not trust the prices posted online! Most items on the menu were between one dollar and four dollars MORE than the online price. We still got out of there for $250 bucks for 4 of us - including 1 1/2 carafes of their decent house Montepulciano and tip - but we were expecting it to be a tad less.
That said, I would return.",,,

I had the chicken parmigiana and a caesar salad. Both were delicious. The chicken parm was perfectly cooked and moist. The sauce was amazing and tasty. The serving sizes were ample and more than enough for a single person.
I highly recommend this restaurant.
Accessibility: This is a very small restaurant and it is not too accessible. The washrooms are up a step or two and squeezed in a corner. The tables are all squeezed together. There is no room to sit and wait for a table. The good news is it is all tables and chairs.

La Rustica,(206) 932-3020,"Lexi H.
Seattle, WA","West Seattle institution with family-owned environment and hearty Italian classics.
The restaurant is located in a neighborhood with plenty of street parking right in Alki. La Rustica is quaint with some old-world Italian decor and white tablecloths - really what you envision when you think ""family-owned Italian restaurant"" so I was into it.
We arrived with a large party for a birthday (reservations made). For a Wednesday evening, it was very busy so I would recommend making reservations. The space is not big (inside or out on the patio), so I don't think they host large parties often. They sat us quickly, and started taking drink orders. They almost immediately brought us water and bread.
After taking our food order, service seemed to slow a bit. We had a late attendee, and they were not acknowledged until we finally caught our server's attention after 15 minutes. It was difficult as the service was great up until this point, and we seemed to have lost our server between ordering food and receiving food.
When the food arrived (which did take a while, but it was a big party and I won't dock points for that), I had to leave for an appointment so I got my pasta to go. I had ordered their squid ink pasta special. It was alright, but I'll likely get something else next time (everything else looked amazing). It was described to have a marinara/alfredo creamy sauce and the sauce didn't seem creamy to me, so I think I may have had different expectations - it was a very large portion, the pasta itself was good, and it had lots of seafood in it. The pastas are also served with a dinner salad - the homemade dressing on those were AWESOME - very garlicky and generously topped.
They serve wine by the carafe for a good price, and the food menu is large enough to give plenty of variety. I will definitely be coming back, this time with a much smaller party, to try out some of the other pastas that looked decadent and have a more intimate experience. I imagine that my star rating will go up after going with a smaller group.
Note: they can't split the check but can take up to 3 payments on a check, so keep it in mind if you're with a big group.",,,

Pros: Our server, Nadia, was very personable and helpful.
The antipasto mista plate was huge. Good vairety of meats, but only one kind of cheese.
Setting is very nice
Cons: The noise level is not conducive to a pleasant experience. I used my phone to check the decibel level and it was pretty steady at 80 db with times up to 87 db. Not fun!
While the wait staff was pleasant there were apparently not enough of them as there was a lot of waiting for water, etc.
The food was underwhelming. In particular, the carbonara was dry to the point of having very little flavor. I am a carbonara fan and I don't want it to be soaking in sauce, but there was almost no sauce at all on this dish.

North Bend, WA","We were lucky enough to snag a table at this happening place on a perfect Seattle Saturday evening. We'd actually had reservations at a different restaurant to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary, but were unable to eat due to their inflexibility with my food allergy. The husband searched restaurants near us offering gf menu items and we discovered La Rustica.
Located down near the water, it has a beautiful view from the patio. Parking was a little tricky, but we enjoyed the walk along the water to and from our car. This family owned place is about as authentic as it gets. With the owner greeting guests and standing outside beckoning passerbys into his establishment, family as servers, and family in the kitchen, you immediately start to get in the mood for a home cooked meal.
We were put on a waiting list for the busy Saturday night rush, but it moved quickly and we were seated outside on the little covered patio with hanging plants and a gorgeous view of the water. Our server stopped by and took our order. Not only was she able to point out their gf items, she also assured me they'd prep my food with allergy precautions, oooo yah bring me allll the pasta.
They have a great selection of gf items to choose from. We started with their house salad which was simplistic yet incredibly fresh and delicious. I went for the gf penne with ricotta which was basically a creamy cheesy bunch of goodness. The husband loved the manicotti he ordered and had nothing left to take home.
We stopped back again just recently and had another perfect dining experience. The husband got the gnocchi and I had the gf penne with a creamy tomato sauce and beef filet. We finished with a decadent chocolate gf cake..There was not a crumb remaining on our plates.
With delicious authentic Italian cuisine at a great price, excellent service, and an unbeatable view, we left fatted and happy and looking forward to our return.",,,

The service was excellent, courses served timely, and just the right amount of attention. The lamb gnocchi, while tender and well presented, was too heavily salted. My partner had the shrimp scampi, which we both agreed was also too salty and grilled shrimp slightly overdone. The last critique would be the cannolis we both had for dessert, which would have been a joy to my Italian grandmother had the chef decided to leave off the discordant note of raspberry drizzle.

Wish they would especially for special occasions. When being seated ask not to be seated at the table near the restroom. Awkward when people are standing waiting to pee as you try to dine..and reminds you that you are near the toilet. They really need to eliminate that table. There is a little bar in back by little I mean it accommodates about 7 to 8 very tiny space. Again if you're not there at opening your wait will be over and hour.

Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA","Good Italian restaurant in West Seattle.
I am normally critical of ""Italian"" restaurants and sometimes a glance at the menu will give me an idea.
In the menu we saw, Lamb is translated into ""Pecora"" which means Sheep. Lamb is ""Agnello"". One wonders why in this modern age, people do not use a proof reader or a decent translator. In any case...
We were seated by the corner window which offers the view of the sound and sunset. We were greeted by the kind owner, and served with fresh, warm, flavorful bread. I ordered an Italian beer and my friend a red wine.
We ordered the Calamari in umido and bruschetta as antipasto followed by Fettuccine alla Carbonara and Risotto Con Salsiccia e Funghi. I found the carbonara dry and bland, I couldn't taste the guanciale, nor the egg. My friend liked his dish. We did not have room for dessert, maybe too much bread...
Judging by the various reviews this place could be a hit or a miss. My suggestion is to go, perhaps not on busy weekends.

For appetizers we got the caprese buratta plate and mushrooms with polenta. For our mains, we had the prawns risotto and Pollo buccatini pasta. Everything was fresh and delicious. The food was rich, but I am not complaining, it was delectable.
Against better judgement, we decided to order chocolate tort to share for dessert, and I am so glad we did. The chocolate wasn't too sweet and the consistency of the tort was spot on.

Los Angeles, CA","We tried this restaurant last weekend. The place looks like a hole in the wall from outside, but don't let that fool you. The atmosphere is great and the food is very good.
We did run into a few bumps in the overall dining experience, but they did their best to resolve these situations.
- We made a reservation for five people (four adults and a baby) on Yelp. However, when we arrived (on time), they told us that their Yelp reservation system wasn't working or they had no way to check the reservations made on Yelp. So we had to wait to find a table - this in-laws disappointing because the reservation feature is clearly present on their Yelp page. That being said, they did the best they could to find a table and get us a high chair for our baby.
- The waiter messed up my order and brought out the wrong pasta. I was hungry enough and started eating it before realizing the dish was wrong. When I let the waiter know, he apologized and offered to take it back. I get bad wasting food and so I finished the meal -- after all, it was quite good. As a consolation, he provided us a free dessert! Now that is service.
Polling the rest of us, I'd say the consensus was that the welcome bread was delicious, fresh and warm. The pastas and sauces were good, not too dry and full of flavor.
I would definitely come back and try something else, probably just make sure that they bring me what I order.",,,

Portland, OR","Walking into the restaurant was the first of many challenges tonight - the doorway was crowded and a crossroads for the staff to enter and exit the kitchen. A waitress took our names down for our 7:00 pm reservation and stated that the online booking system was down, but the wait would be approximately 10-15 minutes for our party of 4. Fast forward an hour and 15 minutes, we, along with many other agitated customers, are still waiting to be seated. One customer was there to pick up an order he called in and he ended up waiting 45 min to an hour. The waitress was reminded 3 times by 3 different people that this gentleman was waiting for his pick-up order. By the third time, she tried to verify his order, got it completely wrong, and rushed to the back (presumably to tell the staff what to prepare). Before being seated ourselves, we looked into the restaurant and saw multiple empty tables that weren't set up. At one point, a different staff member came out and apologized loudly to the crowd, and stated that there was a mix up of events tonight and that they were ""working very hard to get all of us seated and fed very fast"" and that ""no other people will be seated after this group"" as the staff was overwhelmed. As more people showed up for their 8 pm reservations, they were quickly dismissed and told that the restaurant was no longer seating customers, despite any standing reservations they may have had.
The announcing waitress also profusely apologized, and stated that there was no management for the evening and that even though her boss was to blame, we could blame her for the poor service. She also apologized multiple times coming in and out of the kitchen, and stated in an exasperated tone ""this is super embarrassing, it's such a bad look, we're so sorry."" Although the apology was warranted, it was not a professional nor mature look to continuously blame management and apologize about how ridiculous the situation was.
As we were seated, the table only has a wine menu and a couple of dirty glasses. When we advised a different waitress that the glasses weren't clean, she continued to pick each one up for inspection, and frowned when she could not identify which ones were dirty, instead of just exchanging them immediately. It took another few minutes before we had food menus.
To top it all off, after waiting over an hour and a half to eat, our food came out lukewarm and mediocre at best. No compensation was given for making us wait.
Needless to say, we will not be returning and we will not be recommending this restaurant to our friends and family in the future. Management, etiquette, and food all need a large improvement.",,,

Service: 3/5 They seem a bit understaffed because the place wasn't even half full but it took about 15 minutes for a party of 2 to get seated even though it was past peak dinner time... Once we got seated, the waitresses were very friendly though and made sure we got our bread, water, and orders taken.
Ambiance: 4/5 2 main dining rooms with a bunch of Mona Lisa paintings and old pictures/paintings on the wall. It's a little dim inside and I'm not a big fan of the color scheme and decorations. Not the most visually appealing.
Parking: 4/5 Free parking in the lot next to the restaurant. Parking lot is a bit small, but there is also free parking on the surrounding streets.
Food: 5/5 I ordered the Penne Salsiccia Gorgonzola ($18) and my friend got the Linguini Carbonara with Sausage ($17 + $4). This is probably the best Italian place I have had so far in Seattle. Both pastas had amazing texture and the sauces were very tasty without being too heavy. Portions were also very big. The pancetta was a little salty, but that's ok. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Italian pasta. I will definitely be returning to try their other pastas. I have also heard the dessert is amazing.

They had a reduced menu on Valentine's so we opted to get the pollo pesto cannelloni and lasagna. My gosh were these amazing - VERY cheesy but not too salty with great, fresh flavors. We both preferred the lasagna, but the cannelloni had a lot of chicken which helped to round out the meal. There was so much of both that we had to take leftovers home too (which were amazing heated up as well!). We'll definitely come here again for takeout since service was just okay.

Pasta Bella is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. Its a small hole in the wall. The space is tiny and there's always a wait for a table but totally worth it. Not only does the decor feel so cozy and authentic but also the food.
I've been here multiple times for many events and it truly never disappoints. The bread that is served is so divine with the olive oil and balsamic. They also have olive oil roasted garlic you can ask for on the side. The Penn Cove mussels is a great appetizer.
Every single pasta I have tried has been delicious. My all time favorite is the Fettuccine Marsala Fungi!!! Ugh best pasta ever. Their noodles are made to order.. always made and cooked perfectly. Also the Six Layer lasagna is a must try.
My mom loves pasta and is pretty hard to impress with food - as she is a cook herself. I took her here for her birthday and she absolutely loved it.
I would recommend making a reservation. Also make sure you get the deal on Yelp, $20 for $10!!",,,

I went with my parents and we were able to order a good bit of food (super reasonably priced) to try.
Every dish tasted fresh and packed with flavor. Definitely did not skimp on the portion sizes as well.
We also got the calamari as an app (saut茅ed not fried) with olives and tomatoes - it was out of this world.
Go here. Eat here. Come back again and again!",,,

Elk Grove, CA","This place was amazing!!!! Luckily we made a reservation through the yelp app an hour prior because it's a smaller, cozy restaurant for sure. A handful of people waiting who didn't make reservations when we got there but they still got seated within 20 mins. Ordered a ton of food including mussel appetizers, two bottles of wine, fettuccine, lasagna, and much more. Everything was extremely yummy.
Our waitress was the sweetest and one of our dishes was taking longer to come out, so she gave us a complimentary dessert. Also amazing
Overall 5/5. Can't help that there's a wait for yummy restaurants, so make sure you make a reservation.",,,

Issaquah, WA","Have to say the food was fantastic. They were for sure having an off night last night. We were in the lobby at the same time the other Yelper that posted. The venue is small so any surge in crowds, the foyer will not accommodate, especially when it is pouring rain. DO NOT make a reservation on Yelp, you will be let down. Instead try the good old fashioned phone call. The service was slow when we visited but the pasta was amazing. The fettuccine marcella was to die for. I was a little taken back when I got the check because there was an automatic gratuity of 25 percent and a suggested 25 percent at the bottom. I might be a little old school but tipping 50 percent seemed a little pricey, I would review the tipping etiquette prior to going to save the confusion. For sure one of the best pasta houses I have been to in Seattle",,,

For my main dish, I had the Capellini Gamberi Alfredo and it was so so yummy. My boyfriend had the chicken risotto which he enjoyed. The portions were huge - we both took food home, which is surprising as normally when we go out my boyfriend finishes his meal and whatever is left of mine.

Seattle, WA","Pasta Bella is a cute little italian restaurant in Ballard. It's a great alternative to the upscale italian restaurants you generally find, and has an old school charm to it.
The restaurant feels like you're walking into a house. They have two separate rooms/sections, both pretty identical. The decor isn't very fancy, but rather cozy and homely, and the ambiance is pretty quiet. Great low-key date place.
Though the place is pretty large, most of their tables seat four, so a large group may not be the best here.
The food was delicious. We tried four different pastas, and they were very good. I specially liked their raviolis.
We got a half bottle of wine, but surprisingly it was served in a carafe, not in a bottle. I wasn't very happy of how it was served, and would have preferred some clarity on that upfront.
The service, though mostly fine, seemed lacking in warmth. Our original server was very friendly and helpful, but the manager/owner? lady seemed very cold and rude. They kept switching servers on us, and the lady seemed annoyed with our requests for water refills. They forgot our soup (and didn't charge for it as well), which was pretty surprising, but not a big deal.
The prices are at par with the competition, sort of on the higher side for a comparable restaurant.
Overall, it's a cool place worth going to occasionally. Not my favorite italian restaurant, but not bad either. Would recommend!",,,

The scenery of the restaurant is very old fashioned Italian feel. The hostess greets you with a wine menu. All of the pasta's and dishes are very authentic. I had a great spicy wine sauce linguine pasta and the noodles were Al dente! With my pasta I had a glass of Pinot Grigio that went perfect with the pasta.
For dessert I had the TiraMisu which was delicious chocolate had a coffee taste and was moist. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic pasta. This would be a great place to celebrate a birthday or anniverary with your loved one or even just a date. I will be back for a special occasion",,,

Oakland, CA","This meal was a disaster. The food was about 3 stars but the service was so awful I'd give zero stars if possible.
My wife and I are on vacation in Seattle with another couple. They took us out the previous night so we wanted to treat them to a nice meal tonight. Since our last vacation together was in Rome I thought Italian food would be a good choice.
I made a reservation for 4 through Yelp and we arrived right at 7:30. We were greeted and seated promptly. A few minutes later our server brought water, warm bread and olive oil. So far, so good.
We ordered appetizers and entrees. We drank water, asked for refills as it was a hot day and the restaurant did not have air conditioning. We asked for more bread. 45-60 minutes went by with no food. My wife asked the host and she explained that they were short staffed. She said to let her know if there was anything she could do. There seemed to be four tables occupied so it wasn't crowded but I think there was only one cook. It would have been nice if we had been warned there would be a very long wait for food BEFORE we were seated, or at the very least, before we ordered. We shouldn't have had to ask where our food was. Also, they could have offered complimentary drinks at that point.
The appetizers came soon after our inquiry. My wife and one guest enjoyed the shrimp pesto appetizer. We also had the special sun-dried tomato pistachio crostini. Two of us liked it, two did not. We also had the gnocchi in creamy tomato sauce which was ok. And I had the Caesar that was also just ok.
Then we waited. And waited and waited. The host cleared the appetizer dishes and asked if we wanted dessert menus. We explained that we were still waiting for our entrees. Perhaps she was embarrassed, who knows, but from that moment on she became rude and unpleasant - details to follow.
Our entrees finally arrived a full 90 minutes after we were seated. One guest and I split the puttanesca and a vegetarian version of the gnocchi. My wife and other guest shared Halibut with citrus sauce and linguini Amatriciana. All of the pasta was over cooked. The puttanesca sauce was fine. The gnocchi was ok. My wife liked the halibut but our friend didn't care for it. By the time the food arrived we were rather irritated.
The waiter said he would comp dessert and drinks. He cleared the table while my wife was still eating and even brought dessert menus before she had finished her meal. Only two of us wanted dessert and three coffees. They tried to get cappuccino or espresso but the waiter said the machine was broken. RIGHT. Then they asked for plain coffee. He said that since they closed at nine it was too late to make it. I pushed back saying it wasn't our fault that we waited an hour an a half to be served entrees. He acquiesced and brought out two decafs. The host brought out the two desserts and practically slammed them down on the table. Then the coffees and one tea arrived. She brought out a handful of little tiny portions of half and half and flung them onto the table. All of this with no eye contact or one word from her. After she left we had to laugh because her behavior was so ridiculous.
Then we waited and waited for the bill. We finally were getting up to leave to pay at the register when the bill came. At that point the host said some pleasantry as if she hadn't been awful for the past several interchanges.
I usually tip 20% or more on the entire bill but I only left $10 which was 10% of the pretax bill. In retrospect, I should have left nothing. The waiter wasn't rude, he just didn't let us know there would be serious issues in getting our food and then made a grand gesture of comping things he didn't have or wasn't willing to make.
Mediocre food and horrible service. We have another week in town and you can be sure we will not return here.",,,

I walked past here on a walk with my dog (after getting a horrible coffee from Fulcrum around the corner) and I smelt truffle right away and marked it in my mind that I would walk back and grab something for a late lunch.
This place has been on my list for a while but they are only open during lunch so its really difficult to make my way here during that time.
I got the truffle pasta and man, it probably one of my favorite pastas to get in Seattle. It has pretty simple with truffle oil, cheese and butter but man, it is perfect. I did get the special salad which was an asparagus and carrot salad which went perfectly as it was pickled and helped against the heaviness of the pasta. Sadly they ran out of garlic bread but it was already a lot of food. Its enough pasta for 2 meals. Just writing this makes me want to go back.",,,

It's a small restaurant with very limited seating inside. The line can get pretty long during peak lunch time.

I was disappointed that their one and only seafood (shrimp) pasta dish was not being served that day due to no shrimp. I got the bolognese and my friend got the pesto. The flavors were definitely very strong, however, the pasta noodle and onions in the dishes were very, very salty. The noodles were also very al dent茅... if you're into that type of pasta. My dish was $12 which wasn't bad for SLU fresh pasta, but not the best deal either.

Bellevue, WA","The first time I came here, I was told that the worst day to come is Friday due to availability of ingredients. What days I come to this place... Fridays (yes I am a glutton for punishment).
As of fan of the sister restaurants (Le Messe, Haymaker, Raccolto, and others from General Harvest restaurants) I definitely wanted to try this one as it is for lunch and the prices for the pasta are relatively cheap.
This is definitely not a sit down place and while it has some seats, it is definitely a fast casual restaurant to probably buy food and take it to go. The place is definitely small that during the main lunch work hour it would definitely be packed.
There is a relatively small menu available but the options are good ones and the times I have been there, I see an additional special. Again, sometimes some options are unavailable due to availability (late Friday,
Prawns) but there are enough options to find something you would like plus one time they replaced a missing ingredient with something else and it went well.
It's a great way to get bucatini with clams or just tonnarelli with truffle and parm. Plus fried oysters or kale salad for appetizers (and relatively cheap). Plus, I am not mad at the portions. I could save half/a quarter after a meal if I want (but I am a champ)! Plus, they don't skimp on the cheese.
Overall, it is great for what it is. If there is space, you can sit down with a Pellegrino (blood orange) or a white claw (nothing too alcoholic because you may have to go back to work) and enjoy good pasta. Plus you get a map of the other restaurants in the company (not all of them are on there though).",,,

Seattle, WA","This restaurant is like a pasta factory, churning out fresh made to order pastas. It is a very small place so it's often hard to dine in and the line sometimes goes out the door. During peak lunch time around 12, it takes quite a while to get your order but the line dies down at 1.
The pasta is always very fresh, especially the tomato sauce options. The noodles are usually cooked al dente. They don't have a lot of options with protein but the two they have (spaghetti bolognese or gemelli w/chicken) comes with a good serving of their respective proteins. All of their pastas come with fresh grated Parmesan as well.
The truffle tonnarelli and the gemelli w/ chicken are quite rich & heavy. Even though I personally like the truffle tonnarelli the best, I do get tired of the strong flavor it has. If you're looking for a lighter more fresh option I would go with one of the two tomato sauce options spaghetti bolognese and the tomato rigatoni w burrata.",,,

The service is extremely sweet and I love the variety of the menu! I honestly don't know how they are able to cook so many interesting pastas.
Today we had the special of the day with tonarelli, rigatoni alla Bolognese (they were sweetly able to do this with rigatoni as opposed to spaghetti and removed chili pepper for my elementary school son), and bucatini with chili. All three were delicious--my favorite was the Bolognese. I could have this weekly and not get bored of it. The pasta was cooked to perfection.
This is fast becoming a new favorite the only drawback is I wish they had more comfortable seating especially for the price point :(. We lucked out and were able to get counter seats but have skipped out eating a couple of times when the restaurant has been overflowing.",,,

This store is open for dinner and weekends, though, so a decent alternative. Pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente, which I really enjoyed. The sauces are good but a bit muted/simple. We tried the spaghetti with bolognese and pesto. I like the bolognese better, especially since it had some spiciness. The pesto didn't have a strong basil flavor. We also ordered a piece of focaccia and the snap peas. The focaccia was nice and fluffy but because it's doused in sauce, the parts that weren't immediately eaten got soggy (so eat it right away!). Personally didn't like the snap peas. Half of it was celery and I didn't like that the cream wasn't fully incorporated so it was like curdled cream bits.

Shoreline, WA","Chef's Vendemmia is top notch. Haven't been to Raccolto. Le Messe is a toss up. Traffic - constant downtown Seattle face palm. Finally, visited G.H. Pasta located by nearby construction and parking hell late this afternoon (11/20/19). I cannot even fathom what this place is like when Amazonia and other downtown workers have lunch here.
The kitchen staff at 1400 were still slammed, like crazy busy! The slamming of dirty pans into the dish tub added to the din. High ceilings, bright windows with today's sunshine. Tight quarters counter space wise, but lots of takeout. Dirty counters (gave our area a good wipe down at the end). Empty water pitchers and initial icky red water glasses left around (eventually refilled with ice water once I placed them at front counter...note slammed staff).
Rigatoni with tomato basil and burrata tasty, but had to have The Homie polish it off at the end. He had the Tonnerelli with Truffle Oil and copious cheese. Rich and decadent.
I know it's practical to have compostable forks and bowls, but doesn't do the pasta justice when it's for here and not takeout. Very welcomed ice water once made available. Bus your area at the end. Treat it like a campsite. Leave it better than you found it, which we did. Eat it and go, no lollygagging here. Got a parting thank you as we departed.
For those pasta bowl cravings, still prefer Il Corvo in Pioneer Square, Pasta Casalinga at Pike Place Market, Due on Broadway/Capitol Hill, and Grassa in Portland OR.

Seattle, WA","My oh my, what a truly special place this is. Located in Belltown, this new spot is making a serious case for best pasta in the city.
I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. After ordering my food at the register, I was able to immediately grab a seat at the small shared table in the middle. Within 10 minutes, my number was called, and I went to the counter to grab my freshly made order.
I ordered the spaghetti with bolognese and an order of garlic bread. Typically, I'm not a fan of bolognese due to it being too sweet. However, this one was different. The sauce itself was very meaty, and it gave the dish a very satisfying, comforting feeling during my meal. And then the noodles themselves were so good. They spaghetti is thicker than the typical Parillo spaghetti you're probably used to, giving you a much more substantial bite. They were perfectly cooked to al dente - the outside still required a slight bit of effort to bite through, then the insides were super soft. They topped it with freshly shaved parmesan, which added a nice salty element as the cheese melted into the dish. By far, one of my favorite pasta dishes I've had in my life.
As if it couldn't get any better, the garlic bread was amazing. I got two hefty pieces, which was much more than what I was expecting. The bottoms developed a nice crust so that there's a brunch when you bite into it. And then the rest of the bread was super light. Topped with freshly shaved parmesan, definitely one of the best garlic breads I've had.
For how satisfying the meal was, it was very affordable. My meal was around $17, and I got a TON of food. Each pasta will cost between $11 to $14, which I think is pretty affordable compared to other places you'd go for fresh pasta.
The place is super small and located in one of the apartment buildings. It's tough to see from the outside, so be sure to follow your GPS. Inside, there's one small bar table that can seat 6, as well as maybe 10 additional bar seats. Wouldn't recommend coming in a big group, as seating can get pretty tight.
This is a super casual spot - no water service. As such, please be sure to bus your own spot. The bowls they serve their food in are compostable, and they have a tray for your used water cups.

Seattle, WA","How can I say no to homemade pasta? I've had my share of homemade pasta from restaurants, and a lot of them are hit or miss. Sometimes the noodles are undercooked, and sometimes overcooked. This wasn't the case here - my noodles were cooked perfectly and had such a nice chew and bounce to them. I got the Bucatini with shrimp that was on their menu board, but was going back and forth between that and the Rigatoni. The sauce was creamy and spicy, with tiny shrimps scattered throughout. It was hearty, but not heavy, and just overall a good pasta dish, and maybe the best handmade pasta dish I've had!
The shop is super small, so there was a line out the door when I arrived, and line when I left, but I had no problem finding a spot to sit at. It seems that people just grab and go. After ordering, I waited five minutes, and they called out my number. It was hard to hear some of the numbers they were calling, because of the amount of people in the small space, but I was able to stand up front to hear better. They do everything in to-go containers, which I thought was interesting. They are sustainable, and most people DO take to-go, so it's understandable.

Seattle, WA","Automatic 1 one star for having some 90s alternative rock blasting upon opening.
I'm not sure if they were behind because someone called out, or because of something else, but they seemed a bit rushed with opening/making sure things were out (ex: no forks at any of the seating areas). Cleanliness also seems to be a second thought, at least at the seating areas. All of the counters hadn't been wiped down, which was particuarly gross since the place just opened, which means it was left from the day before...
I was the first one in and only waited 10 minutes for my order. If you're dining in, they'll give you a little metal stand with a number and then you can choose your seating. (Plastic) Forks and napkins should be in the placeholders at the seating areas, and yes the pasta comes in the compostable bowls even though you're eating in. Once you're done, the recycling and compost bins are by the door, and there's a bin for any water glasses to be returned.
Thankfully the pasta was tasty, the sauce really was the winner. I went with the Rigatoni with Burrata, but found out after ordering they didn't have any but could sub in mozarella. Half the pasta was overcooked, but I'd prefer that over a soggy mess. Again, the sauce was really the winner and if they sold it I'd happily take home a jar. I was also relieved the sauce didn't have oil in it, as others noted some of the pasta dishes were swimming in oil.
With tip and no drink, my order came in just shy of $15. Not too bad considering this is Seattle, and it's within walking ditsance of the Amazon Campus and Space Needle. I may come back and try their bolognese, but I'd take it to go.
Lastly, I found it odd that even though I paid with a credit card the cashier was still typing in the details on the screen even though he swiped my card. Tad concerning when a cashier doesn't explain and the customer has to prompt them to.
Tips:
-Street parking (per the norm of the area), though be mindful where you park as the area has quite a bit of construction and is around several aprtment complexes. Thus, there may be stricter parking restrictions

They portions were just the right amount and I felt a little bit guilty eating everything because it was carb overload. But it was so good. Especially the sauce they use for the bucatini pasta. It had a good kick. I was bummed that they used tiny baby shrimps for the pasta because when I was mixing everything up, my shrimp sunk to the bottom and it was hard getting everything in one bite. I think if they used bigger shrimps or prawns it would be a better experience. For the side of garlic bread, they give you 2 generous size of garlic bread and topped with freshly shaved parmesan. All I can say was it was sooooo good. Salty and crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. Great compliment to my pasta dish of choice. The price was worth it because they cook your pasta made to order. The bucatinie was about $12 and the garlic bread was almost $5. I think they also make their pastas fresh too in house.

Seattle, WA","This place was a nice surprise! My friend and I were craving some Italian food and we decided to check this place out. I had not heard much about it and, *surprise*, I didn't even check Yelp before going... Everything was quite with a small hiccup in service.
LOCATION & PARKING //
It's in this very small and dark side plaza in Edmonds (across from PCC). It's not very well lit from the outside so keep an eye out if you're using Google Maps or something. I had to make a small u-turn once I realized I passed it. The location itself is small but cozy. There is parking in a private lot so I wouldn't worry about that.
FOOD //
I got the FARFADELLE ALFREDO with CHICKEN. I love anything with alfredo so I figured this would be a good choice... and it was. First of all, the other reviewers are correct. The portions here are huge. I only ate about 1/3 of my plate and took the rest for home. The pasta was smooth and buttery. The sauce was not too overwhelming and it was the right texture. Some places make these dishes too ""saucy"" but I felt like there wasn't a pool of sauce on the bottom. In fact, the sauce just coated the pasta, as it should. They also give a decent amount of chicken too! Best part? The pasta tasted just as delicious as leftovers.
I also want to touch on the complimentary bread... because it was super soft and fluffy. Seriously, go for it.
AMBIANCE //
Like I mentioned before, it's small and cozy. I didn't expect that from here. It's strange to say, but it reminds me of a cozy inn in a small town. It's a great spot for families, dates, friends, etc. The entire vibe is very intimate.
SERVICE //
I feel quite conflicted about this because the service from the servers was absolutely fantastic. I never felt rushed to order or pay the check and they consistently checked up on us. My concern here is how we (and other customers) were addressed and seated. When we arrived, there was a man who seemed to be in charge of seating everyone. We weren't acknowledged for 5 minutes and when he walked us to our table, it felt like he was annoyed at us/servers in general. It was quite strange.
OVERALL // 4.5 stars
I had a great experience here and will consider coming back if I'm craving some Italian food. Not sure what really happened with the small service problem though...",,,

Mukilteo, WA","This is one place where you really can learn a lot just by looking at the photos. You can see hearty Italian food, fairly traditional, presented beautifully in a nice dining room. That's a good summary of what's on offer here.
This is one of many strip malls in block after block of strip malls on the way down to the Edmonds ferry. There's just enough parking (barely).
Inside, everything's just nice enough--you're not paying for a bunch of fountains and premium real estate, but the whole bar and both dining rooms are pretty. Dimly lit, nice earthy paint colors on the walls, fun vintage ads, nice furniture and table settings. There's not much of a lobby, and the place gets busy. They don't take reservations, either, so you might be waiting outside if you come during the rush.
The menu is fairly short. Lots of classics, almost always with local ingredients and some creative touch from the chefs and cooks in back. There's a wine list, and a few beers on tap and in bottles. Full bar, too.
For food, one server pointed out that their special list really is the creative heart of the kitchen. What they feel like cooking and the ingredients they're most excited about are what shows up there. The regular menu has tons of stuff you want, too, and it's where the starters are. They're always welcome with any meal.
The food here runs to a hearty, home-cooked vibe. Some of the ingredients are a little fancier than your average home dinner, but they slow-cook the sauces and give you big portions; you feel like your grandma is worried you're not eating enough, so she gave you this. Not only is it a big serving, but it's something she figures you'll eat every bite of even if you're getting full.
Even the lunch portions are huge, by the way. The dinner portions blow those away. You could easily order fewer entrees than you have people and share plates, especially if you get starters.
We had the caesar salad, which has real caesar dressing made from scratch in house. With eggs. Real caesar! I love it. You can get anchovies, and you can wear your server out waiting for just the right-size mountain of fresh ground black pepper. This is a proper way to start a meal. They're also constantly bringing you out some really nice bread.
We got a bottle of a local cab for $35, from Virtue. It was an amazing bargain at that price, and suited the meal perfectly. Their headquarters are close to Edmonds, too, which is cool.
For entrees, we had the Pescatore Romano, which was a mountain of shellfish and a little finfish on squid ink pasta. The Tre Ragu was a heap of elk, lamb, and something else on big noodles. Both came simmered in garlicky, herby tomato sauce (I assume slightly different recipes). We couldn't finish all the fish, but the meat dish was all gone, right down to the last of the sauce sopped up with still more bread.
We missed the desserts and after-dinner drinks, but this was a huge hearty meal served quickly and presented beautifully for less than most places charge for such ($135 for 4 total plates + wine). This would be an easy place to get addicted to. We'll definitely get back.",,,

Provo, UT","Most authentic Italian place I've been to. Was pretty skeptical with this place because it is a bit pricer and I wasn't sure it would be worth it. Mamma Mia I was very wrong. Guys!! Come here.
I got ""the grinder"" not really knowing what it was going to be like. They came out with a literal canoe-shaped thing of bread that was perfectly cooked, crispy, and fresh. It was filled with multiple cheeses, very unique cut of salami (my absolute favorite), tiny onion bulbs that were still intact but cooked and caramelized to perfection, and a bunch of other flavorful things that made this one of the best Italian dishes I've had! I was really hungry and I couldn't even finish it! Had to take the last little bit home because it was so good. Portion sizes parallel the price you're paying so don't let the price deter you too much.
The other reason this place is 5 stars is because the service here is unmatched. They focus on the little things like making sure your drink is always filled up, replacing the appetizer bread (that is free) before you can think to ask for more, giving everyone a mint at the end, giving you a full rundown of their specials, having thick towel-like napkins, going out of their way to thank you for coming in, and so much more! For me, those little things go a long way.
Some big things they do is hook you up when you misunderstand what you ordered. One of my friends thought they ordered something that had a similar name to something else and when they brought it out she realized it was not was she ordered. The waitress took it back and within five minutes she brought out the correct one. It wasn't anyone's fault but they took on themselves to make the customer a priority. We were all very pleased.
The only thing I didn't like was the water because it tasted a little like plastic. It was only the first couple refills that had that taste. But besides that, I got nothing but positive stuff to say!
Great Italian atmosphere that is authentic, hospitable, inviting, packed with freshness and flavor! They just do it right here.",,,

Seattle, WA","I'm no Italian but I felt right at home. I felt like we were treated like a family even though it was our first time here. They made us feel like our business is important to them and that out presence mattered from the moment we entered the restaurant until we walked out that door.
When we arrived at the restaurant for an early dinner, there were several people waiting for a table. The owner Anthony happened to be entering the restaurant at the same time like we did. He smiled widely, greeted us and held the door open for us. The two of us were able to get a seat immediately. Bread is served as a starter as you browse through their menu (olive oil and balsamic vinegar at the table). Our waitress was super nice and all smiles. She made recommendation, checked on us a lot but mostly gave us our privacy.
We got the half salad upon her recommendation, portion is actually huge. I could overhear our waitress saying the same thing to other patrons that the Caesar's salad is the best that she has ever had. But I agree that it was indeed very good. For meal I got Di Mare Puttanesca which was their squid ink pasta served the entire habitat of the ocean in it. I mean seriously my plate came with a generous helping of lobster, tuna, rock fish, mussels, clams, calamari, octopus, and prawns swimming in a spicy marinara with capers, anchovies, and Kalamata olives. Dear God the portion is HUGE! Meanwhile he had the Carbonara Antonio with smoked pork belly bacon which was delicious though a little on the salty side.
We weren't able to finish our meal because we got sooo full. Nonetheless we couldn't pass on dessert. We opted for Spumoni as it would be easier to swallow than cake. Well, I love the spumoni. We got three scoops and it was not too sweet.
Excellent service with great food. I definitely enjoy the vibe here. It seems like everyone knows everyone, truly feels like being among friends and family in here. Parking can be tough, but they mention there's another nearby parking that you can park at (I think it was at the bank or something.. I can't seem to remember the exact details now - please call the restaurant for details.)",,,

Pleasant Grove, UT","This is a no-nonsense, legit Italian eating place. I lived in Italy for 2 years and returned back to the States 9 years ago. I'm always a little... or a lot... let down when I try Italian restaurants because it's just never the same as the real thing. This is the first Italian place since Italy that I have loved! No complaints. I'll even let the chicken Alfredo dish slide since I understand they have to appease our misguided American demand.
This trip made my 4th of July weekend. Great food, great service, fair price for the quality and quantity you get. I wish I didn't live 3 hours away. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but the I side is nice, and their attention is on the food...none of the flashy stuff.

Denver, CO","Long live this meal.
Bucatini is a hidden gem tucked away in an Edmonds strip mall. The low lit, romantic wine bar is home to 5-star eats from beginning to end. It truly was a perfect dining experience and I need to write this review while it's still fresh in my mind!
Oddly enough I didn't order a pasta dish. I know what you're thinking, ""Matt, are you okay? Is something bothering you? Why aren't you consuming pasta 24/7?""
I'll tell you why. Typically at a fancy Italian restaurant, I would 100% order a composed Italian pasta dish. However, Bucatini has...get this...a Heroes & Grinders menu! Any good Italian knows the immortalized significance of this. I am so, so happy with my decision to order ""The Grinder.""
The Grinder - Capicola, Mortadella and Calabrese Salami w/ Grilled Caramelized Onions & Provolone on Toasted Ciabatta. Say hello to heaven, folks. This sandwich had it all; salty, savory, sweet, cheesy and crispy components that worked phenomenally. Plus, the sandwich was the size of my head. Have you seen my head? Yeah, it's that big!
I'm also not one to praise a salad, but the Caesar Salad I ordered prior to my sandwich was a 6-star salad. Homemade dressing, whole leaf lettuce and deliciously addictive croutons, with a squeeze of fresh lemon elevated this salad into a beautiful starter.
Service was stellar. Our waitress knew the specials like the back of her hand, filled every glass, and was continuously one step ahead. The owner even came out to talk to us and the other tables, which is always a memorable touch. Cannot recommend Bucatini enough!

Beacon Hill, Seattle, WA","Wow! What a great, local, neighborhood restaurant. Upon arrival on a Saturday night we were absolutely shocked by the amount of people that were waiting. It didn't seem that busy until we realized ... ""OH it's really busy."" We waited for about 30 minutes till being seated (which I think was relevantly short compared to others) and we ordered immediately since we had plenty of time to browse over the menu.
We decided to go with the Steak grinder, Bucatini alla Napolitana and the Bucatini with Homemade meatballs. Warning: that is A LOT of food for just two people and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day. During dinner the severs and the atmosphere reminded us a lot of home and everything was right up our alley.

The grinders are made from fresh quality ingredients and certainly provide at least 2 meals per sandwich with the true Italian serving size (reminds me of my gramma). Next I'm ordering pasta! They make it in house and with everything else being so fresh and seasonal I can't wait to try it again.

Durham, NC","""Delightful Italian in slightly out-of-the-way strip mall""
We came here with a group of 6 on a Friday night at 6pm and were fortunately able to be seated in this rather small place, though the restaurant filled up very quickly thereafter. The restaurant is at the end of a strip mall with very limited parking, but there are signs noting that you can park at a nearby bank. One of my party has a severe legume/ soy allergy, but as with traditional Italian food (but unlike some chain places), this restaurant only uses olive oil and occasionally canola oil.
The setting is a bit dimly lit and cozy but not TOO crowded. The servers were quite attentive-- our glasses never fully emptied, and both they and someone I presume was the manager checked on us repeatedly. I was still full from lunch so I just ordered a caprese salad. My dining partners got the caprese classic sandwich, a different salad, or the Di Mare Puttanesca. We had delicious bread while we waited (refilled as many times as we wanted), and there was olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table.
The food was DELICIOUS.
The caprese salad was a bit small, but exceptionally well done. It was exactly what I wanted. Probably not meant to be a meal by itself, but a good appetizer.
The caprese classic sandwiches were the salad in a GIANT half-ciabatta, and decorated with a cute Italian flag. Everyone loved them, and the bread soaked some of the balsamic and oil making it also delicious. Pro-tip: do NOT order this sandwich toasted-- it comes out like a giant crouton. It's nicely crispy without toasting. This will fill up a hungry eater for sure.
Our friends enjoyed their puttanseca and salad immensely too.
Overall, an excellent local, out-of-the-way option for high-quality Italian food. The price is fair for the high quality-- definitely a significant step up in quality, food presentation, and ambiance from Olive Garden and such (though I like those too).",,,

Seattle, WA","I would give this place 5 stars for the quality but for the egregious prices of the pasta dishes, I have to take off a star for that kind of abuse on my wallet.
I went with a friend for happy hour and we ordered two happy hour pizzas. We thought they were a fair price for the size we got. Since the happy hour pizza wasn't enough for a substantial meal, we ordered the lasagna. When the waitress brought the dish, it was so tiny that I thought it was a happy hour portion even though it wasn't on the happy hour menu. Turns out that it was the regular dinner size lasagna for $16. It didn't come with a side of vegetables or even a slice of bread. For a small bar/restaurant, this crazy price was definitely a big surprise. But my friend and I both agreed that the pizza and the lasagna were good.
If you come in for the pizza that this place is known for, you'll walk away happy. Just don't get the ridiculously small size lasagna (other pastas on the menu are probably the same tiny portion) or your Italian grandma will be sad that you spent all that money and didn't get enough to eat.",,,

Food is under proportioned, overpriced, and tastes like very generic grocery store condiments are used. Our antipasto and pizza had a solid 30 minutes in between being served to us- takes way too long to be placed on our table.
The pizza was underflavored, undercooked yet overcooked in some parts, and very small? My party and I utilized the chili oil and chili flakes a little too much.
It also took our party several tries to get the server's attention to get the check. We were really polite the entire time and there was maybe one other party in the restaurant.
Out of everything the Saute di Vongole (Hama Hama mailla clams oven roasted in white wine) were probably the best.",,,

I ordered a pizza for delivery Sunday evening, still hungover from a WILD Zoom party the night before, and my pizza arrived as it always does - hot, delicious and even quicker than usual!

Our server greeted us and took our drink orders promptly, and our food arrived much faster than we had anticipated. The pizza was fantastic, I got the Palermo special and it was the perfect combination of topping flavors, rich cheese and perfectly cooked crust. The menu variety was a little shocking for such a small place, I was pleasantly surprised by how many options I could pick from. I will have to come back to try some of the specials that our server suggested, they all sounded delicious but tonight we were in the mood for pizza.
The only downside to our visit was something a few members of our party witnessed. We noticed a young woman eating in the back of house in full view of the restaurant. I'm not sure what her role was, for the most part she was simply standing around talking with other employees and eating from what I saw, but regardless it was pretty off-putting to see what appeared to be an employee eating in the back of house where guests could see her. It made me wonder what the standards for that sort of thing in Palermo's back of house were. Having worked in restaurants for a while I'm assuming that this was a one time mistake that doesn't happen frequently, as I know there are usually strict rules about not eating where guests can see you. I hope that the employee is talked to about the behavior!

We also got the chicken fetuccine alfredo ($10.50) which also comes with your choice of the soup or salad. Since we were sharing, we ordered both a soup and a salad.
The soup of the day was chicken noodle. I was actually really impressed with the soup. I loved how thick the noddle was and the flavor of the broth was really good. The noodle was the perfect texture! The pizza was way smaller than we thought it would be, it was really yummy though. The fetuccine alfredo tasted pretty mediocre, no complaints. The two breadsticks it came with was really good.. nice crunch and yummy garlic flavor.
They have happy hour which is nice, I might come again during those times. They also serve breakfast all day! The food was good but I wasn't blown away.",,,

The spaghetti bolognese was a joke! NO flavor what so ever! The side salad that comes with the pasta is completely bare! Couple strips of lettuce a slice of tomato and slice of Cucumber. Ranch super watered down. Sandwhich and pasta was tossed out! Complete waste of money. Would not recommend and will not order again!",,,

San Leandro, CA","Picked up some takeout from here for a relaxing home dinner on our recent Seattle trip.
The Classico meat pizza was very much American-style - thicker crust and tasty albeit crazy dense. It's not often I start feeling full after just one slice. This was quickly outshone by some creamy, derricious fettuccini carbonara. The pappardelle al pesto, however, was surprisingly overcooked and one-note in flavor.
On the upside, portions were gargantuan and we barely made it through half our of dishes.
Overall, a decent spot for Italian that leaned a little too far towards run-of-the-mill Italian American ""red sauce"" fare.",,,

I got a Calzone and it was INCREDIBLE!!! I could only eat about half of it.
It wasn't too busy on a Monday night, and they had plenty of space for my whole party with no problem (we had 5 in our party).
Favorite thing about this place: I love the huge selection of items. It's almost overwhelming. And very reasonably priced. Everyone who ordered pasta said it was to die for, too.

However, today, I decided to try something different and ordered the frittata/quiche. It
WAS not that at all! Lol instead it was an egg pizza (which I would NOT have ordered if it was properly labeled in the menu).
It was truly unfortunate, as that was my meal, and hopefully my friends' kid who will be coming over later will eat it.

Is the quaintest, most delicious Italian restaurant.
The food is fresh, authentic and most important, delicious. My family has celebrated birthdays, babies, and just life here for years.
Recently I brought severed friends from New York and New Jersey here for a late night dinner. I think it's fair to say this region of the country is VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THEIR ITALIAN. They were ready to be unimpressed. Because if the late hour it was pretty quiet and I was feeling the pressure.
They LOVED it and declared it some of their favorite Italian in the city! I feel this gives a little extra validation.
My favorite dishes are the pear salad with a 17 year old balsamic vinegar and their puttanesca which if it's not on the menu the chef can be persuaded at times to make it.

We were welcomed by our server, who was attentive, friendly, and genuinely seemed to love his job. The restaurant is small, but it's warm and inviting. I felt like I was transferred back to somewhere in Italy.
The server took time to learn our wine interests and made recommendations, bringing out several for us to taste. We ordered our food and it arrived quickly. The menu is fairly traditional (meaning it's light on the meat options).
I ordered the risotto and WOW was it good. My mouth is watering just thinking about it....

Bonney Lake, WA","I don't know what happened last night, but we'll never be back. Had an 8pm reservation. After being seated nothing happened. No one said a word to us. No quick hello. No drink order. No ""be right with you"". Sat there until 8:15, and this place isn't that big. I know 15 minutes doesn't sound like a long time but when you are just sitting there in a tiny room, believe me, it is. Started to get worried that no one around us had food. When I thought a server was finally coming to us she stopped at a table next to us that had been seated at least 30 minutes and asked if they were ready to order. Nope. We had a show to go to and this almost hijacked the whole evening. We left.
By the way, quick note, take this as you will. A young poorly dressed couple came in when we were waiting. Like, girl was wearing a Rugrats T-shirt. They looked scruffy but seemed like a nice couple looking for a date night. They asked if there was a table available and the girl said no, fully booked all night. Literally a minute later a better dressed older couple comes in, asks same question, gets told there's a 20 minute wait. My wife and I were like ""hmm, that just happened"". I imagine some might like they do this, protecting their otherwise nice ambiance, but watching it happen was off-putting to us.",,,

We started with the arugula salad and soup of the evening, which was a white squash soup..super tasty.
As our main entree, we ordered their two specials. One was lobster fettuccini and the other was Osso Bucco with risotto! OGM..both were outstanding!!
We brought our own bottle of wine, but each enjoyed a delicious glass of champagne while our wine was breathing:)
Our server was great. The only thing I didn't like was the complementary bread...not my style...but everything else was AWSOME!

Marpole, Vancouver, Canada","Great little hole in the wall. If you want a near Italy-like experience, eat outside. The tree canopy and surrounding apartment complexes add to the experience as if you're actually in Italy. The service was excellent. Waiters and owner herself checked on our table frequently to make sure the food and experience was high in quality to which it was. You must go for the black linguine and smoked salmon. One thing that prevents this place from being a perfect 10 for me is that the surrounding area is full of questionable people. One example was a man who was offering free blowjobs. But being a great little hole in the wall, it really takes you away from all that noise even if the free blowjobs were waiting for you outside.

The restaurant is definitely a small hole in the wall but the decor is nice and the tables were cozy without being cramped.

Seattle, WA","Note: I would say the restaurant is more of $$$ than $$ as your price per entree will likely be over $30 a person if you're going for the more decent dishes but not surprising as it seems like the spot is made for ambiance.
We got the bruschetta to start and two glasses of red wine. The bruschetta had a bit too much garlic and wasn't easy to eat as the bread is tough. Flavor-wise it wasn't bad but I don't know if strong garlic breath is what I wanted after this dinner.
For main entrees, we got the Risotto ai Funghi and a squid ink pasta topped with calamari and a few prawns. The risotto was the most expensive bowl of rice I have eaten. I did enjoy the flavor of the risotto though and it definitely is rich. However, I don't think it looked great so... presentation was a bit lacking. The squid ink pasta itself was mediocre at best. ""Meh"" was my thought after taking a few bites.
I did like the fact that they brought out a tray and explained the desserts before we decided on one. The tiramisu was a bit overly sweet and lacked more coffee notes.
Towards the end, I could see many tables start to leave while we did not get the check. We finished around 9 PM and stood up around 10 PM to walk up to the counter. It was only then that the wait staff asked us if we were ready to check out. Places like pho restaurants do that because service is not really a thing there. For a restaurant of this caliber, that can be pretty unacceptable and it made me uncomfortable as I did not want to flag someone down.
Overall not very impressed with the food portions or quality. Even though the spot was cute, my partner and I don't think we'd come back unfortunately as we've had much better for a more reasonable price in the area and more attentive service.",,,

loke you could get a bottle of vino and just eat for 45 mins on the amazing food while chatting with friends (or strangers at the next table). Wine pours were very generous and while it wasn't a typical name brand wine list the wines were very good. Outdoor seating wasn't available but I could envision amazing ambience if it were.

The outside area was super cute/beautiful for date night. They have tables surrounding a pretty fountain right next to the entrance of the restaurant. The interior is also very intimate and tiny. My seat was pretty uncomfortable because I was so close to the table behind me...
The food was good but nothing stood out where I wanted to come back. We ordered the Fettuccine ai Funghi and the Fettuccine del Bosco. The serving size was also pretty small compared to most other Italian places I've been to. Normally I will have to always take at least half of my pasta dish to go but this place made me feel like I needed to order more after my meal... The service was pretty slow and the waiter barely checked up on us. Food 3/5, Service 3/5. There seems to be a lot of other Italian places nearby. If you are visting Seattle like I was, I would recommend going to try somewhere else.",,,

We actually only picked it because it was quasi close to our hotel and we didn't want to be stumbling around in the dark, in the rain. We were glad we did. Really sweet and romantic place. Charming, with a intimate setting for a date night. Loved the chandelier. Our server was kind and quick, answering our questions about the menu and giving suggestions. Really great server. I decided on the home made linguini with smoked salmon in a lemon cream sauce. My husband ordered the spicy sausage penne with a tomato based sauce. I also ordered a glass of wine. I have to say, with the low prices to high quality wine in the stores, I was disappointed with the price per glass of wine. And no half liter house wine specials. This should be a given in a Italian restaurant. Prices were slightly high but in the acceptable range of what we were generally eating in Seattle. Definitely my pasta was the winner. Delicious springy noodles in a rich creamy lemony sauce with generous portions of salmon. My husbands pasta was pleasant enough and generous enough, but the home made noodles made my dish shine. Definitely worth a check if you are wanting a romantic date night.",,,

The restaurant is super intimate and radiates a rustic, authentic Italian restaurant. The space is small and the decor is of neutral stucco, with purposeful cracks in the walls that added to the old world Italy feel.
They have a piano, and at the the time we were there, they had a pianist playing. This is a very romantic space. You would not know this restaurant is located in Belltown because it's hidden behind tall gates where It appears that there is only a water feature. The restaurant is off to the side within the little courtyard.
We did enjoy the food. But it wasn't so super delicious that I will crave the meal again. Service was slow and unconventional particularly with the wine. They opened a bottle and put it on the table without asking anyone to taste it first. They didn't keep our water glasses refilled so we shared our water.

Turns out they were having a winetasting that evening for a very reasonable price of two people for $15 so my friend and I went to the back and decided to try it. We enjoyed it tremendously and are some for the evening, Tim was very informative telling us stories about the significance of we were drinking. The Rathburn Chardonnay in particular comes with the story and is featured in an upcoming movie by Tom Skerritt. Based on a book that my friend had actually read.

The ambience is wonderful - it is such a charming restaurant. The service was excellent. The bread they serve with the herb olive oli is very good. We were starving so we got a small salumiere pizza to start and it was tasty. But it was too pale - it needed a few more minutes in the oven. I did love that they brought a little ramekin of fresh grated parmesan cheese - which was delightful.
The hubby got the pork belly ravioli and I got the special ravioli - crab ravioli in a lobster sauce. Both were exceptional.
My main criticism was the dessert. We got a hazelnut gelato to share and sad to say...it was not gelato. I am not sure what it was. I have eaten a lot of gelato in my life - I have even had it in Italy. And what we were given was not creamy gelato. It was crumbly. It actually crumbled in to chunks. I have never seen that happen with gelato - or an ice cream. I don't know if it was old - or over churned - or what happened. The flavor was delicious and it was full of hazelnuts. And the two marinated cherries they included were wonderful. But the texture was not good.

Shoreline, WA","Time for an updated review! It has been nearly two years to the day from my last visit to Ristorante Piccolino's.
This is a long time Seattle favorite in the Ballard/Sunset Hill neighborhood. Established, polished, refined, but without the stuffiness. Often a reliable spot for celebratory get togethers, socializing at the bar, family meals, and date night. It also has an adjacent bakery and cafe and expansive terrace area.
Three months ago, tried to dine with the MKE Yelper in search of tiramisu. But the entire restaurant was closed for a film shoot with Hollywood stars TS and MS. Can't divulge this as it is a work in progress.
Returned this evening (9/15/19) with The Homie and was lucky to find nearby street parking and snag a two top without prior reservations made. With two newish establishments across the street, Samara and Baker's, parking can be a bit of a challenge.
From the host, our waitperson, and support dining staff, highly attentive service is provided. Menus, ice water, wine list, and bread service are provided upon being seated. Towards the end of the meal, another waitperson came over to say hello. She remembered us from visits 2 and 3 years ago!
We started with the Antipasto Misto Classico ($16), a generous array of marinated/grilled zucchini, peppers, mushrooms, artichokes, tomatoes, olives, assorted cheeses and meats.
The Homie surprisingly went with a generous bowl of Rigatoni Salsiccia ($22.50) versus his usual Spaghetti Carbonara. Thick slices of Italian sausage simmered with a flavorful tomato sauce. Enough to box up that he will definitely have a delicious lunch tomorrow.
I ordered one of the featured dinner specials, Wild Forest Mushroom Ravioli ($23). Handmade ravioli with a trio of mushrooms in a cream sauce. I greatly appreciated that it was not heavy or salty. I savored this at Piccolino's, but admit to finishing the remainder while writing this updated post, patting my chubby tummy.
Wrapped up dinner with an espresso ($3) and Cheesecake ($8) for dessert. Again, The Homie didn't go with his usual gelato, made from a very old family recipe.
Me - definitely the tiramisu, no surprise ($8). Wish the layers were soaked just a tad more in espresso or coffee liqueur though. Delicious nevertheless and savored slowly.
Yes, a definite culinary splurge in a lovely dining setting. Makes one's visit a bit more special. But added bonus for consistent and well polished service plus palate pleasing cuisine, this is worth every dollar!
Definitely recommended!",,,

Seattle, WA","I've been meaning to write a review for a while because Picolinos truly deserves the credit.
This is by far the BEST Italian food outside of Italy that I have had. My husband and I have been coming here for about 5 years now - mostly for special occasions - and it's still one of our favorite restaurants.
We recently came to celebrate my husband's birthday here and had yet again, a wonderful time! I made reservations a few days before and we were seated on their patio, which is filled with lots of plants, beautiful flowers and some decorative statues. You don't for a second feel like you're in Seattle!
Our server greeted us right away - he was SO friendly and took good care of us the whole evening. We got their bread and fresh pesto, which they make in house. They have a different specials menu each day so we started off with a salad off that menu, which consisted of butter lettuce, nectarines, berries and pistachios - it was absolutely delicious! And perfect for sharing :)
For our main course, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara, which I had been craving for a really long time, and my husband had the Spaghetti con Polpette (essentially spaghetti with meatballs). I have to say that I wish the carbonara was a little more creamy, because it turned out a little dry for my liking. But my husband enjoyed it and his dish as well.
And since it was my husband's birthday, our server brought out a free tiramisu on the house, with a little candle, so it was a really cute way for the restaurant to help us celebrate :)
I can't rave enough about this place, and am already looking forward to coming back!",,,
Ristorante Picolinos,(206) 781-8000,"Julia A.
Seattle, WA","My husband was really craving Italian one night and wanted to take me to this place - my favorite cuisine is Italian so I was excited right away, and rightfully so!
We arrived a couple minutes late from our reservation time, so it took about an extra 10 minutes for us to be seated at our table. Boy, were they BUSY the evening we came here for dinner! We didn't actually have the server come to our table to take our drinks/appetizers order until at least 10-15 minutes after we were seated. Most of the time, we would be very impatient at this point, but we did see how busy they were that evening and saw plenty of servers running around frantically, so we were okay with waiting. We ordered the Bruschetta di Pomodoro for an appetizer - absolutely delicious! We also ordered an appetizer off the specials menu (for the life of me I cannot remember the dish name) but sadly they were sold out of it. :(
For entrees, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara and my husband ordered the Spaghetti Con Polpette. The Carbonara was absolutely delicious. But I will say there are few restaurants that make Carbonara truly the way it should be made (sadly Picolinos does not make it in the proper way) but it is still very delicious. My husband also LOVED the Spaghetti - he loves lamb and I'm not a big fan of lamb. His comment to the lamb meatballs was ""it is very lamb-y"", haha!
We truly enjoyed our dinner experience here, despite the longer than usual (I'm sure) wait times. I'm excited to come back here again!",,,

Seattle, WA","Picolino's back garden bar is the perfect weekend hideout when you're needing an escape from the noise and congestion that has become Seattle.
You may have already heard that Picolinos offers great pasta, especially their spaghetti carbonara, which is so good that if you stick some on your forehead, your tongue'll slap your brains out trying to get to it. Honest! I've eaten here many times (just never in the garden) and it has always been good.
Now, let's get back to that bar in the back.
The garden bar is only open on weekends during warmer weather, which is prime time to sit and sip and forget everything. Nobody's going to rush you back here. Have a couple of Negronis or some beer before moving on to wine with dinner like we did. Gloria Gaynor and the Village People are playing in the background. I love this place.
The super-friendly bartender on duty last Friday was a real kick. This funny guy never intruded, but made us feel right at home. Scruffy barman would make some clever remark while resting his forearm on his knee after propping up his foot on something behind the bar and we would all laugh.
I like a barkeep who acts like he owns the place (or maybe he does?) yet never gets pushy or tries to sell you on something. He never asked us anything stupid like, ""would you like a salad with that?"" or ""how is everything tasting?"" This guy is a pro. His only unsolicited questions were ""what'll it be guys?"" and later on, ""how're you doing?""
Although quiet and unobtrusive, he was always visible, so if we wanted something, we only needed to flag him down.
His bar service alone receives 5 perfect golden A+ stars.
Oh yeah, and the food is delicious, too. Did I mention the carbonara? You're going to want some of that.
I'm so lucky I can walk here and stumble home. You should get a lyft or a cab if you can't hoof it, but do come here and sit in the back bar. It'll be one of your favorite new spots. I know it's one of mine.",,,

Came here for my friend's birthday dinner and had an amazing time. He had a reservation for 8 people, and got a booking easily.
We wanted to get a seat outside, but they had closed the outside area due to the weather. That was the only bummer for us in the whole experience.
The food and service was excellent. They had an elaborate specials menu, and they also did a custom order of truffle oil pasta for my friend. The rigatoni, wild mushroom ravioli and gnocchi were super appetizing but the custom truffle oil pasta was amazingly delicious. We didn't order a wood fired pizza and desserts. But I'm definitely gonna try that in my next visit.
This place is nested in a residential area in Ballard. It was easy to find parking on weekdays. I am guessing this place is packed on weekends.",,,

Although my go-to dish of choice is usually the gnocchi, on this occasion I tried house made ravioli special and was glad I did; I can't remember the last time I had such delicious raviolis.
Not only was the food great, but the whole restaurant was transformed into a Christmas wonderland - I felt as though I was having dinner on the stage of the Nutcracker by Sendak.
The wine pairing suggested by the waiter went well with the ravioli... and my friend and I enjoyed the after dinner cappuccino, tiramisu and cannolis.
The only issue I had was that it seemed like the dining space was a little more cramped than normal - as every time the wait staff passed behind me, my chair would wind up getting bumped.",,,

A word to the wise if you go in through the door to the most right, you have entered the breakfast and lunch counter and you don't spot that, they may tell you they are closed not realizing you came for dinner next door.
Once we got past that, we were treated by a friendly staff with more than the minimum of on duty folks.
Each of got a bread basket which is nice as some places charge extra for a few slices of sub par bread, not here.
Caesar salad was ample and nicely dressed.
If toy want traditional carbonara, they leave out the eggs, but still call it by the traditional name. It's good, but it isn't carbonara.
The other dish was a puttanesca which could have done with more traditional olives and capers but was still quite good.
Both dishes were ample and a good value for the price which made for left overs the next day.

Renton, WA","So this is a few months late as I recently decided Id love to give feedback on the places I've been to, both good and bad. Picolinos would fall under the GREAT category, If I lived down the road id be there 2-3 times a week if not more. However I have been there half a dozen times every time the experience is spectacular, ive recommended this place to so many.
Lets start with the atmosphere not your typical atmosphere very rustic and unique which I like, especially at night time. Great date night spot as it has a very romantic atmosphere, first time I was there I spent 3 hours on a date just enjoying this place.
The food ive had is incredible, would very much recommend the Margherita pizza as an appetizer and as for the entree I can only give a personal recommendation for the Pork Belly Ravioli as its the only thing ive ordered just with how good it is, I get it every time. Although others I have gone with have complimented how amazing their dish was so I can only assume their entire menu is just as delicious as the one I order is.
As for the drinks ive had, they make one of the best old fashioned around and I know my old fashioned. I have had a few of their wines as they do have a very extensive wine list.
With all that being said, I would highly recommend experiencing Picolinos for yourself, you will not be disappointed and this wasn't just a one time experience and review for me, ive been a number of times and im still blown away by this place, if you love Italian food, you need to check this place out.",,,

Seattle, WA","I am writing this review after many many transgressions with this neighborhood establishment. If you ask.. why did you continue to go to this restaurant if you have had numerous bad/awful experiences, there are only two reasons: one, some of the service staff were amazing; two, proximity to my house. To be honest, the food has always been mediocre at best and the restaurant is so poorly run that it's a 50/50 chance that you will have cold food, bad food, or an awkward run in with the owner and his ""managers"".
Over the last ten years, I have had my wedding rehearsal dinner there, hosted large birthday parties, assisted in a large wedding reception, and recommended friend to do the same. With the exception of my rehearsal dinner, every event has been tainted by large mistakes, hidden charges, and general dishonesty. Last Friday, I hosted my husband's 40th Birthday, mainly because of the easy access for my guests, and also I thought by ordering family style and an open bar would be hard to mess up. I was wrong. They insulted my guests on many occasions and gave us 1 member of their staff for a group of 30 people. This staff member worked so incredibly hard at serving, bussing, and bartending it was impressive. However, it made the experience feel stressful and rushed. I made the best of it because I didn't want to ruin such a monumental party with our closest friends, but I left with a bit in my stomach about how everything had gone down. Most of all the treatment of my guests. It was embarrassing to say the least.
I will NEVER return to this restaurant for dinner, and I recommend at the very least, you should avoid having any of your treasured life time events at such a mismanaged place.
10 years of keep their lights on at times, is over.
Update on my response to the dishonest owner of Picollinos:
Oh...and now the owner is saying we tried to skip on an additional cost.... the next day. Wow, stay away from this restaurant for events. Apparently, they are the nightmare that just keeps giving.
I stand by my statements. All true. All my opinions. Tom, if you don't like bad reviews.. learn how to treat any and all customers. If you have a problem with addition costs that you deem worthy of bothering a customer the next day. Take it up with your staff. I brought all the wine in during business hours and paid a corkage fee. This was MY husbands 40th. Although my mother-in-law paid for the majority (not all). I planned the event...and had the evening totally spoiled. Seriously, take a review and keep it moving. This ""relationship"" is done",,,

Sure, there are meat dishes on the menu, but this is a place that clearly takes its pasta seriously. You want to come here on a carb cheat day. Picolinos is, and deservedly so, known for their housemade raviolis. But realistically, you can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes. The Rigatoni Salsiccia and Spaghetti Con Frutti di Mare are both outstanding. Even the pizza is pretty good, but it's best as an appetizer for a table of four. Not sure I'd make a meal out of just that.
Dessert? Tiramisu is top notch. I wouldn't bother with anything else when this is so good.
They even have live music on occasion. Wine list is dominated by Italian varietals and PNW selections.",,,

Seattle, WA","I'm a fan. The small shareable plates at Raccolto are excellent. I have literally enjoyed every single thing I have ever tried here. And that says a lot, because I don't like a lot. The cavatelli pasta ... yes, please. Always a must-have. The service is knowledgeable and warm without being intrusive. The location on California Ave in West Seattle has given our neighborhood it's first real contemporary Italian option. Helpful note before you go: The restaurant itself is small. There is a counter bar in the back I have sat at once, but otherwise always been seated in the main space and it's just not big and not cozy or warm. More like open and bright. Make a reservation on Open Table or call ahead. Most of the time you don't need to do that in WS, but here you should and you will get right in.
Now the negative. Despite liking the food and all, I'm giving them 3 stars for two reasons: 1) a couple years ago I wanted to have my office holiday dinner here. Tried to set it up way in advance. They were SUPER rude and dismissive. That alone kept me away for almost a year. 2) Came by once with friends when there were tons of tables open and they were weird and wouldn't seat us, saying they were booked. That's fine, but major attitude. We went and ate down the street and walked by to the cars two hours later and the same tables were open ... they didn't turn over. After these two incidents I almost never wanted to come back. But after some time I did. And it's good. I still won't be a regular given the above, but at one point I would have written a one star review (after someone was a massive jerk when all I wanted to do was spend thousands of dollars for a dinner party and rent out the whole place) and swore I would NEVER go back ... so the theme of this review should be ""forgiveness"" and a hard-earned three stars that is a testament to the great food.",,,

Seattle, WA","We came here a few months ago and it was 5 star perfection. The brussel sprouts, the burratta, the chicken. Amazing. This time was disappointing, but for the amazing pasta, which is worth the trip, despite the missteps.
There were serious timing issues that ruined the flow of the evening.
We made the mistake of going ahead and ordering food before drinks arrived. We waited over 20 minutes for drinks. Appetizers came before the drinks and were piled onto the table before the drinks even came. Then we waited an hour for the rest of the food.
The chicken was NOT the chicken we had the last time we were here. It was fatty and very salty. A lot of waste.
The cocktails were stirred in dirty shakers. There were multiple flavors in the drinks and when it was brought to the attention of staff, they were defensive and refused to mix a new drink, clinging to the claim that we didn't know what we were tasting. The waiter served the drinks with his fingers all over the rims of the glasses. He carried the drink in dispute back and forth from our table to the bar 3 times. No apologies or offers to mix a fresh drink in a clean shaker. It was awkward and instead of refusing the drink, we just relented. So disappointing. Instead of insisting on being right, why not just mix your clients a clean drink?
We loved this place when we came in October. Perfect timing. Very low key gracious service.
Don't know if it was an off night or if this is what to expect going forward.
Don't like to express disappointment in my own neighborhood, but for the premium prices we should expect premium service and quality of food.

Do not miss the pasta course because it truly is the star of the menu. The appetizers are almost equally good - highlights for us this evening were the Swinomish oysters with fresh horseradish, the crab salad and the smoked fish. Entrees were just okay - portions were small (albeit well prepared). They just didn't light us on fire. We skipped dessert because we were stuffed. I would come back to order all of the pastas to share, and maybe 1 appetizer per diner (also to share). Great service all around, too - never an empty glass on the table.",,,

Seattle, WA","I dined here during restaurant week and did not have a good experience. I've had Raccolto bookmarked for awhile and was really excited to try the food. The restaurant is really nice and is aesthetically pleasing. However, I wasn't a fan of the fact that by the time I left the restaurant my clothes had reeked of their cooking.
The food was okay for the most part. I liked that the appetizers course had about 4 different plates to share at your table. I got to try a little bit of everything that they offered. My main was the halibut and it wasn't very memorable.. The plating was fairly sloppy. I can tell that they were rushing to make my plate.
The service was not good. Our server was initially pleasant, but I noticed a shift in her attitude and pace after I declined to opt into the wine pairings. A couple who also shared the same server as us arrived later than we did and received their appetizers and mains before we did.. We found that odd as everyone in the restaurant that day was essentially receiving the same meal. I just wasn't understanding her logic in serving people who came in about 10 minutes after we did? She never checked in on us and never refilled our water even after we had put the bottle on the edge of the table. Our plates of food were just being plopped on the table and she would vanish to cater to someone else's needs. I'm not sure if it's something we did, but we found the service to be unacceptable.
I think it's pretty obvious that I would never choose to dine here again.",,,

We started off with bread and Brussel sprouts - the first bite was good but after that all we could taste was salt.
After waiting for awhile (and watching a larger group that came in well after us get their food before us) our two pasta dishes finally arrived with apologies for taking so long. The rigatoni was topped with pork and kale - I guess I didn't expect to see salty pork carnitas on top of a bed of over oiled/buttered noodles.
Pesto bucatini lacked flavor outside of the flick of the wrist of salt that was on every.single.thing.

The server couldn't have been nicer. She took the tagliatelle off the bill and comped our Americanos, which I appreciate.
Mine was barely warm enough so I went ahead and had it. Flavors were excellent, good sized portion. However, it sat uneasily in my stomach for a very long time afterward.

Even with a reservation you may find yourself having to wait for a bit as it's a small space and they're always busy, but it's definitely worth the wait. Both times we've come we've ended up getting seats at the bar and having a cocktail while we wait for a table and the drink menu is always fresh, creative and delicious.
We got the steak tartare both times because it's that good; don't skip it, just order it and be happy.
This place does all fresh pastas and damn, they are delicious and noticeably better than anything you were planning on making at home instead. Could go on and on but just know this: everything we've had here is worth the cost, the wait, and more.
Finally, excellent service both trips in seal the deal. Our server last time in was so knowledgeable, friendly, nice to chat with and even comped our drinks for no apparent reason other than maybe because we had to wait a bit for our table.

Seattle, WA","I've been eyeing this place for awhile and finally got the opportunity to go here this evening with family. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice, clean and simple. Here is the run down of the experience:
Appetizers: Down right the best part of the meal. Loved the flavor profile of each of these dishes and I would have been content with just eating this alone.
1) Burrata with olive tapenade and crostini's.
2) Charcuterie - Salami, watercress and a sweet whole grain mustard with crostini's as well.
Pasta: Unfortunately, the pasta had a lot left to be desired.
1) Rigatoni - Braised pork, kale and parmesan. Was really bland and watery.
2) Bucatini - Pesto, tomato and parmesan. Was really bland and watery as well.
3) Strozzapreti - Bolognese and parmesan. Was the best tasting pasta dish of the evening, but lacked a good punch in flavor.
Drinks: We ordered a black manhattan and shared between us. Loved the flavor profile of this drink.
Service: The gals working tonight were attentive and very nice. Unfortunately, our main sever for the evening needs to not assume things. He was really trying hard to make the sales pitch to my family elders and pretty much focused on them. Seriously, treat us all equally, instead of sucking up to the people you assumed were going to be paying the bill. The look on his face when he realized he screwed up when I gave him my credit card to pay the bill was picture worthy. Also, we indicated that this was our first time at this restaurant and I stated I'm a regular at GH Pasta Co, but he spoke to me in minimal words that this place is not the same and much more upscale. Ummm... ok. There was no need for that pretentious vibe.
Overall, I say stick to eating the appetizers and having a drink here. If you want pasta, seriously go to GH Pasta Co. in downtown Seattle. Owned by the same chef and the pastas are fabulous! I'm hungry just thinking of the super flavorful pasta dishes one can get there.
Note - The bar is small and if you want a table you'll need to have a reservation. If you don't have a reservation, look on their online reservation service for availability as there actually might be a table available sooner then what the hostess will indicate to you in person.",,,

To those who say ""this is the best Italian restaurant they've ever been to"", I say you must be a Seattle native. Salt is the prominent taste in every dish.
The steak was fatty, the Halibut was bland. Having to pay for bread and olive oil? How d茅class茅. Service was good, wine selection mediocre. We brought our own bottle of Napa Howell Mountain Cab. The waitress gave us white wine glasses (right) and never poured one glass for us, even though we paid the corkage fee.

I pictured Vito's as a place The Godfather was filmed and I think he would have been proud to dine here. As luck would have it there was a great cover band playing which livened they dark ambiance. A few couples took to the small dance floor which was fun to watch. It was too loud for long conversations but we were quickly silenced by an array of deliciousness. I would definitely suggest the lasagna or the Farfalle Diavolo (if you like a little spice). Our favorite appetizer was the Gamberoni & Polenta.

Seattle, WA","This is the spot if you are looking for classic old school New York Italian. The atmosphere sets tone with the dim lighting, piano bar and laid back vibe. Food was exactly what you'd imagine: our pasta was loaded with a spicy vodka sauce, which had a great flavor but was just too saucy for me. The pizza was thin crust but sort of tasted like the out of a box kind. My favorite dish actually was the house salad - mixed with a nice champagne dressing and beets. So all in all this spot is really about the experience, not where you go for an authentic Italian meal. Also the food took forever to come out , which wasn't a big deal because our waitress was lovely and we had entertainment and lots of great people watching (the place was packed!).",,,

Easily a one-stop spot for the whole night out- music started for us around 9:20pm and went on into the night, I think we left after midnight, hard to keep track of time but once you're inside it's easy to just let go and enjoy the space and people here. Thanks to the wait staff, kitchen wizards, fast bartenders and jazz musicians (The Michael Owcharuk Ensemble whose GOT rendition at the end was insane) that made our Friday so enjoyable.

That's amore.....When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore
That's amore
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling.
This was the song that was in my head the whole time during our visit to Vito's. I was excited that they offered live music and have 2 different varieties of musicians (1st one was Italian music focused and the other band that performed at 9pm was more New Orleans Jazz style).
It was a Saturday night we ventured out here, Note* we called to make reservations but they were booked however, the bar area is first come first serve so we took a shot and went anyways. If you want a table- make a reservation.
The venue is fairly small so I can see how the tables fill up fast. We sat at the bar, bonus they had happy hour until 7pm on a Saturday. Love my happy hour specials and even more when they offer it everyday of the week.
We ordered the following off the happy hour menu:
prosecco and red wine $ 5 each
Vito's Sliders (2)** they were delicious
We also ordered the Farfalle Diavolo $18
(sausage, prawns, spicy vodka cream sauce) I modified it to try to keep it clean as possible.
The ambience is what really made our visit unforgettable, the ""Italian band"" really sounded German to me but it was just a different old school vibe, I was digging it. Plus the red leather couches, mirrors and disco ball.. just picture yourself back in the days.. I bet there are stories. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to locals and visitors.

It's very dimly lit for an intimate dining experience. There's a private room in the back called The Cougar Room which can be booked for parties. The bartenders are knowledgeable and no nonsense. They always have vegetarian options. Last night I enjoyed the bruchetta, and a Caesar salad which was perfectly wilted - half a romaine head just the way I like it with a lemon wedge on the side. I sampled the main pasta dish without the tuna, which had some nice flavor profiles. They cycle through specials, so be sure to check what's available when you're there.",,,

I reserved a table in advance. Dinner was delicious and this review is about the SERVICE.....because it was SUBPAR. Our waitress, named Stephanie was unfriendly, lacked customer service skills or even normal people skills and just seemed to be annoyed or just didn't want to be there....
Our table is a friendly, happy group...not demanding or mean and we all have a lot of grace when it comes to others.
Her attitude made several of my guests uncomfortable and her lack of service was obvious to everyone because it was discussed later.
Our bill for our dinner was SUBSTANTIAL and we left a very gracious tip...even with the poor service, which honestly I should have reevaluated the amount we left.
I know that when I go out for a meal I want great service..that's why we go out...for the experience and I don't want to cook! I expect to feel good at the end of the meal on all accounts.

The table service was exceptional and the patrons we talked to were a treat. We had zero issues until we moved to the bar. Actually there were two bartenders; one was great, the other one was an ass. She was rude and loudly talking about a couple patrons that we saw to be very nice. I'm not sure if they didn't tip enough, or if they were just the wrong color? To be clear since we didn't catch her name, she was the bartender with the palest skin white sleeveless blouse and the most tattoos. Given the fact we had the best long weekend in Seattle that we could hope for, we had to overlook this person and her terrible attitude, or else she would have ruined our entire trip. I'm sincerely hoping her boss sends her to diversity and inclusion training , or else fires her and hopes she learns to be a better person in the future.

What a deal! $45 gets you a pizza, pasta, salad/appetizer and a bottle of wine. The portions were generous; unlike some of the other places we've tried, they weren't skimping on size. We had the arugula and beet salad, with a lovely light vinaigrette and plenty of red and golden beets plus a creamy ch猫vre. The gnocchi were clearly hand-made, and while not as fluffy as my personal preference, still very satisfying in a creamy gorgonzola sauce. We actually saved the remaining sauce to use again even though we finished the gnocchi. And the pizza! Crisp crust with a hearty chew and high-quality toppings (for us, arugula and prosciutto). Excellent. And the white wine we got was crisp and fresh - a ""green"" taste for springtime. All of that would have been plenty of food for two, but we opted to add an order of brussels sprouts which were delicious: crispy-fried to perfection with a tangy dressing sweetened with honey and finished with crunchy toasted hazelnuts. We were too full to finish them, but I'm happy to have them for leftovers today. 100% will be back!",,,

They have a great menu. Pizza seems to be the bulk of the menu but they do have a few pasta dishes and some apps.
The service was also wonderful here as well. Christian our server was quick prompt and very polite.
We ordered the bruschetta, spaghetti and meatballs, pasta alle vongole, and a bottle of their house red.
First off, the pasta alle vongole. THERE ARE SO MANY CLAMS. I counted there were like 26 of them in there and for $15 that's a really good deal. I do say, I wish there was a little bit more sauce to this because I felt like the dish was a little drying. But still it was yum.
Spaghetti and meatballs is a classic and this one was delicious. Those meatballs mhmmmmm
The bruschetta, was so GOOD! I never have had it without mozzerella but the riccota is to die for and it was all perfectly proportioned on the perfect little toast.
Also I like their wine glasses here.",,,

The good...ZOMG. the food. I don't even know where to start? The brussels sprouts are so good that they kind of defy reason. The pizzas are outstanding, I especially love the mushroom pizza with a hint of truffle oil. The salads are spectacular, and don't even get me started on the buffalo mozzarella with marinated tomatoes on the side. The rigatoni is rich and flavorful and chock full of meat and sauce and maybe magic.

It was a casual weeknight and I recommend coming around happy hour as it can be pricey. Perfect place for date night - they have the ambience with the candle at the table and mood lighting on point. Their menu has antipasti, plenty of pizza options, pasta, and a full bar.
My hubby ordered an old fashioned and myself a house red. Both drinks were superb. I wish I could've watched our server make the drink. It was smooth, a little sweet, and cold. They used a black cherry, which I found to be neat as I've never seen that being incorporated into an old fashioned cocktail.
Our pizza choice was the funghi - essentially a mushroom pizza. If I could get this again I would! It was delicious! Sooo cheesey, mushrooms were cooked perfectly (tender and just the right amount of oil), and some basil leaves on top. The crust was the perfect balance, chewy, but crispy by the crust, with just the right amount of char. The pizza comes out with chili oil and red pepper flakes. I'm assuming the chili oil is Calabrian chili oil which made the dish extra spicy. So good. We are pizza snobs and enjoy a good wood fired pizza and so glad this is just a few blocks away from our place. I can't wait to come for HH and try more!",,,

Columbia City, Seattle, WA","I've been to Bar Cotto a couple times with friends. Yelp has listed ""not recommended for large groups"" and I definitely agree- but that hasn't stopped our friends from choosing Bar Cotto. They always do their best to accommodate, but it can be a little bit of a wait.
I had the Night in Parma and enjoyed my drink- although I think it was a little light on the alcohol. My boyfriend had two cocktails that were heavy on the alcohol so I'm not sure about the consistency of experiences here.
It's a nice cozy place that we've enjoyed eating/grabbing a drink at. It's classier and not as grungy as most of the bars lower on the hill. I don't like pizza (weird I know), but I find Bar Cotto's pizza some of the preferable kind. It's not overly greasy or cheesy and I like the unique toppings.
My favorite here is the Brussels sprouts though. I don't like Brussels sprouts at all, but something about these actually made me unable to stop eating them! I've also tried the meatballs and would stay away (kind of bland and flavorless). Their appetizers are a little on the pricey side, but I think their pizzas/pastas are pretty reasonably priced for the amount you can get and share.
Overall I've had great experiences here and would recommend it if you're in the area. I'm not sure I'd recommend walking all the way up the hill for Bar Cotto from the main downtown area, but it's a great stop if you're headed that way anyways.",,,

The pizza was amazing and might possibly be my new favorite Neoploitan style pizza on Capitol Hill. The meatballs were so zesty #loved. The Ceasar Salad could have been passed on. It was overly drenched in dressing.

Seattle, WA","I frequently order pizza to go from Bar Cotto, and unfortunately they have now messed up our to go order multiple times. On one occasion they had only made one of our two pizza's, so we had to wait more than 10 minutes for the second pizza to be made. By the time we were home, we had to heat up one cold pizza, which defeats the purpose of us arriving on time to pick up ready-to-eat pizzas. On another occasion, one of the two pizzas was the wrong pizza as we had asked about two options on the phone, and they made the one we decided we did not want.
While their pizza is good quality for those who like a Neapolitan pie, their customer service with to go orders has been frustrating. Would recommend being extremely prescriptive if you plan to order on the phone.",,,

We just missed happy hour, unfortunately, as the HH prices are really solid and the regular menu is a bit on the pricey side.
We each got a cocktail (midnight in Parma for me, love the gin/lambrusco combo), then bruschetta for apps, and two pizzas (the A&O and the funghi).
Cocktail was great, just what I needed after a long day. The pizza was really nice, love that thin, tasty crust. The funghi is very subtly truffle-y, just the right amount. Honestly, though, the bruschetta was banging and I'd come back just to eat that.

We had a mostly great dinner here tonight which included some well made old fashions from the bar, gnocchi, bucatini, crab linguini, and a Sicilian pizza.
Added the spicy meatballs to the gnocchi dish and that was the best choice of the night because the gnocchi doesn't come with meat and those meatballs tasted perfect.
The pizza was a perfect blend of flavors and the crust was just crispy enough.
The bucatini cane with the smaller meatballs that were not spicy and the sauce was perfect.
The only bummer was the crab linguini which was too salty. Edible, but the crab especially was heavy on salt and it really took away from the flavor even though the sauce was tasty.
Will go back again and maybe the salt will have taken a chill pill. All in all.... recommend!",,,

Mamma Melina was recommended to me by an avid fan due to their amazing Happy Hour deals (all day Sunday & Monday, what?!) and their delicious Italian food. I have to say, she was right on all fronts, and I'm sold.
A few friends joined me for a celebration of my one-year anniversary of living in Seattle, and we definitely went all out with our menu choices!
We ordered:
- Gnochhi al gorgonzola
- Rigatoni al sugo di carne
- Ziti ai formaggi
- Parmigiania di melenzane (EVERYONE'S FAVORITE!)
- Formaggi italiani
- Margherita pizza
Everything was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. As mentioned, the favorite was most definitely the eggplant, as it was the most flavorful and just overall surprised all of us in its taste. I was also a huge fan of the gnocchi, which was recommended by others, as the dish had the perfect gnocchi texture and the creamy sauce was absolutely delicious.
Overall, for the amount of food that we ordered and our total bill, I'd say the quality and quantity of our meal was marvelous. We all left happy, full, and excited to come back soon for another Monday night Happy Hour!",,,

I had to ask for the beer menu 3 times before I got an answer. Finally when I ordered, it took 7 minutes for them to bring me my beer. Really?

Los Angeles, CA","DELICIOUS ITALIAN FOOD!!
The food: omg amazing! We popped in here for dinner and was honestly blown away! The food was exquisite! For appetizers we ordered two Caesar salads and a margarita pizza. Great salads! - the dressing was light and refreshing. The pizza was AMAZING! It's a Neapolitan style pizza (my fav!) and they truly made it right here. The margarita was a great one to get because it was fresh and bursting with flavor. For drinks we got the blueberry lemon rocks - SO GOOD (very refreshing!) and a glass of red wine. For the entrees we got a risotto ai gamberi - Phenomenal! Absolutely bursting with flavor! We also had the bucatini which was honestly to die for! We also ordered linguine with prawns as well as the pasta e fagioli. All the entrees were absolutely delicious! Truly an authentic upscale Italian restaurant. The prices were reasonable as well!
The atmosphere: a super cool and modern interior with a beautiful (DOG FRIENDLY!) patio! You can dress up or down. They have two spots in the restaurant which accommodate large parties.
The service was great and the food was even better!
Will I come back? YES YES YES",,,

Seattle, WA","Wanting to get some super late dinner, we found Mamma Melina open until 11pm on Sunday! Plus when we got there, we were informed that it was happy hour until closing that night (and Saturday), so we went to sit at the bar area for the happy hour. The lighting here is quite dim giving an intimate/romantic ambience. The setup in the dining area was specially romantic with the classic chandelier and all. I really like the interior here.
The service wasn't the greatest which was apparent the moment we stepped in and not greeted with the slightest smile both from the hostess and the waitress. But I did find that she was quite attentive in checking on us.
We ordered Spaghetti al' ortolano which has grape tomatoes, pine nuts, big chunks of goat cheese and rucola. I don't usually care for goat cheese but this meal was enjoyable thoroughly specially with the crunch from the pine nuts as well, the flavor was very light though. We also ordered the Melina pizza which is the black truffle pizza with mushroom and mozzarella. This one is yum! The black truffle is very prominent. It reminded us with the NYC black truffle pizza that we had (that went viral before), minus the oozing egg.
For drink we got X-rated Tini (mango, passionfruit liqueur with sky blood orange soda) and Plum Blossom (pearl plum vodka, lemon juice and triple sec). Both drinks were very very good. The X-rated Tini is more a citrusy refreshing cocktail, while the Plum Blossom reminds me a lot of a cotton candy type of cocktail. I was pleased with the food and drink. Probably would order their eggplant parmigiana and their risotto next time. For dessert, we were hoping to order their cannoli but the waitress told us that they hadn't made it in a long time so we got their Tiramisu. The tiramisu sadly is pretty standard. Our bill came to about $60 excluding tax. Overall, for the portion and quality, I do find the price to be overpriced. However for a quick bite late dinner, we'd probably go back here again.",,,

The food is good ( it was not my first time there) but the service was too slow - I know, it was mother's day but the restaurant was not so full to justify a 40 minutes waiting time to have our meal. The place is very modern with some touch of classic decoration. You can easily park in the public park at the back of the building. The restaurant is close to the Burke Gilman Bike trail just in case you are riding your bike and getting hungry. Our server - was very nice and polite. I will come back other time but not on mother's day.
My daughter had avocado toast and it was bland. She would not recommend it. I had the gnocchi and it was very tasty. My husband had the salmon linguini and it was ok. I got happy when he told me the food that I prepare was better. So, one star from my daughter, three stars from my husband and four stars from me.

The staff was helpful and friendly, making sure my order was on track while balancing feeding the rest of the group and making sure everyone was taken care of.

They did have a nice spice to it because of the chili oil. It also came with really well grilled bread. The bread basket was the same bread but without the nice grilling. I was so confused with some taste in the bread but I realized it was the olives that were in the bread. Wish it didn't have that. Partner thought the bread basket bread was too hard, particularly the crust. And it wasn't as nice as the grilled bread that came with the clams.

All of those are delicious. During my second time at Tribeca, I decided to order off the dinner menu and get chicken picatta, which was also very good.

We ordered the Arancini balls which were ok, margarita pizza with sausage (good), short rib parpadelle was ok at best. The meat was really tender but the parpadelle should have been run through a thinner setting on the pasta machine and for the love of food salt your pasta water! The seafood ravioli was by far the worst dish of the evening! The flavor was simply off and even though you expect a cream sauce to be rich and heavy simply everything on the dish was heavy. How did they make shrimp feel heavy?!??

For food, we shared the mac & cheese with sausage. It was really good and if I go back, I will definitely be ordering it again. Not eating for awhile and a drink may have played into how good I thought it was though.
We had also ordered the meatballs but they never came. Turns out the waiter did not hear us even though he repeated what we ordered back to us out loud for us to confirm... oh well. Will just try them next time!
For the drinks, I ended up trying the Cherry Blossom and the Italia. Both were sweet and fruity. Not strong to the point that they were too strong for me to drink, but enough to know there was definitely alcohol in there.
The bar fills up pretty quickly after 5. If you are looking to get a table for happy hour, recommend getting there sooner than later. The night we went, lots of groups showed up hoping for tables and the place is not big at all. The counters at the bar were filled up and so were the tables. The staff made accommodations for one group to squeeze into the back but there weren't enough bar tables for everyone who was showing up.

This is not Elegant Dining, but definitely Fine Dining. We were a bit concerned when we entered due to the huge crowd at the bar and the noise level, but there was a holiday party going on, my guess is its normally quieter.
And again, so many great options to choose from on the menu!! All their pasta is made in-house from flour imported from Italy. We started off simply with the bread basket, no, it's not free, but it was great, nice crust on the outside, moist and chewy inside, the way we love it. The rosemary and olives incorporated in the bread made it perfect.
After much deliberation, I got the Frutto Di Mare, a seafood soup similar to Cioppino, paired with a glass of Dimajo Sangiovese. My wife got the Salmon Risotto and a Sauvignon Blanc. We were both thrilled with the meal! My meal was absolutely spectacular, wonderful layers of intense flavor, lots of seafood, great squid ink pasta. The salmon was cooked exactly to my wife's instructions, and was beautifully presented. AND, the wines were really good, and only $10 a glass! In Seattle!!

Ordered the meat balls to share (enough for 2 if you're looking for something small to kick off) followed by a beetroot salad with a side of salmon and the beef fillet. Both were excellent and my steak came exactly how I asked. If you like your salmon a little more cooked rather than pink in the middle best to ask, I'm not a fan of really undercooked salmon unless it's sushi. Nice atmosphere and not noisy, clean and tidy to boot.
Service was prompt and friendly which suited us as we were both tired! It looked like this place could get busy, this was a Tuesday and fairly early evening (5:45 ish) so I would recommend booking ahead if there are more than 2 dining.

Pasta is prepared al dente, just how I prefer, some may feel it's undercooked but it was perfect in my book. My favorite pasta was the black squid ink pasta. Sauce was full of flavor, a bit spicy, but not super rich. I prefer some protein with my pasta so got a side of meatballs which wasn't my favorite, just tasted a bit blah. Steelhead fish was also very nicely prepared. Other winner was the soup of the day prepared with vegetables and small lamb meatballs, soaked in a light delicious broth! Bread from Columbia city bakery is a great way to start off the meal. Also highly recommend the saffron risotto ball, so tasty! We obviously ate quite a bit!

First- get an early reservations. If you get a reservation after 7pm you will likely have to wait 15-30 minutes for the prior table to finish their meal as guests tend to linger and the service is on island time.
The salads are good, the veggies they use are very fresh. The entree's were forgettable, if not offensive. I had the pork entree and it was reminiscent of a Hungry Man Chicken Fried Steak, at $34, you can see how I might be a tad underwhelmed and even offended. My dinner date stated his meat dish tasted like a fancy Hamburger Helper. Another diner in our group had the squid pasta, which must be for an acquired taste as no one in our group was a fan.
I would come back for the wine, the cocktails and the can't be missed deserts as long as I had a reservation that began before 6pm to be sure I could be seated in a timely manner. For dinner, I guess it's an acquired taste, but we weren't digging it.",,,

throughout the night and had wonderful conversations that seemed genuine!
We started off with bakery bread which tasted delicious and light but not as fresh as I'd wish it would've been but should've been expected. Would've been nice touch to have some warmed bread. We also ordered the arancino which was really delicious especially the mozzarella in the middle of it. Wonderful touch!
For entrees, we ordered spaghetti with meatball and the popular Squid Ink spaghetti. Both entrees were spectacular and left me full. I personally enjoyed the meatballs on the spaghetti, definitely a unique taste to a classic staple.

La Medusa is a quaint staple in the neighborhood. Weekends are hard to get a table but worth getting on the list or make a reservation.
The food is simply delicious. We had the aracini and beets to start, so good. We ate them too fast. The bread , I assume is from Columbia City next door, you get a variety of their delicious breads.
We had two pastas, the spaghetti and meatballs , wow! Simple fresh marinara sauce and unforgettable large meatballs. The meatballs is tops , tender and full of flavor and not salty, I asked the server what the recipe is for the meatballs and of course she smiled and wouldn't tell me.
We had the squid ink spaghetti vongole , so good again subtle flavors , perfect clams.
We had our third course of the veal shank and polenta. We did not leave anything , plate empty! We like to compare how veal shank is prepared when we travel so La Medusa is succulent and tender and not salty like some I have had.
The dessert course is never to be missed at La Medusa , Pana Cotta is exceptional, we had the chamomile and honey water one, omg we wanted another. We also had the pistachio cannoli , you have to ask why aren't they bigger?!

My only complaint is with how long the food took to come out (at least 45 mins from ordering). I actually thought the kitchen staff might have walked out, and there was not good communication or really any sort of acknowledgment of the delay by the staff.
I had been to this place a few years ago, and will defiantly check it out again, but won't rush back as I can't take the risk of waiting like this again.
Barring service issues, this could definitely be a 4/5 star place.",,,

We had reservations sat down at 730, waiter did not a knowledge us for 30 mins? He was just standing around doing everything but come over , restaurant was not full at all? The bus boy was filling our water to kill the time, I ask him to inform the waiter we were ready for service, another 10 minutes go by, with zero apologies took our wine order another 20 minutes goes by! All this time I can see him just standing there? Decides to bring us wine glasses but no wine! Another 10 goes by he brings the wine. Took our order, food came out slowly, never checked back, except for the bus boy! We had to ask him again to ask that waiter to come over! Ordered another bottle, 20 minutes later he shows up with wine? My friend complained to deaf ears they claimed there was no manager? Over all the worst service! Never going back. Tip him 0! I tipped the bus boy!!!",,,

Seattle, WA","Very good, well-established Italian restaurant in the hip and getting hipper Columbia City neighborhood...
THE ROSES: Food is quite good, with what appears to be a rapidly-rotating menu (no printed menus; current offerings are in a blackboard on the wall. Dishes are well executed, and service is quite good. Fun location with good view of the local scene. Upscale but friendly and unpretentious clientele makes for great people-watching.
THE THORNS: Even on a weeknight, parking is quite difficult in this neighborhood. Not as bad as Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, or Fremont, but no picnic. While having no printed menu and just relying on a chalkboard saves money, it's kind of a pain for those seated at far tables or with their backs to the board. Some dishes (fish soup) could be a little more aggressively seasoned. A little on the spendy side for what you're getting, especially the wines (nothing under $10/glass - they really need to offer a simple 'vin ordinaire' to compliment the rustic ambiance and menu).
THE VERDICT: This neighborhood institution's culinary offerings make it a real Seattle 'destination restaurant' as well. While a little spendy, it is a definite standout in Seattle's crowded Italian restaurant market. Recommend.",,,

Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA","I want to start off by saying my girlfriend and I have both been in the service industry for almost 10 years, so we have seen some sh*t. We are not the typical snobs to write negative reviews on a place just because the food was under salted. That being said, this was hands down the worst restaurant experience we've ever had. We made an anniversary reservation a week in advance, stoked to try this friken pasta. We arrived at 7:30, and our table was not ready. We waited an additional 15 minutes to be seated at a table (that wasn't so great to be honest) and ordered drinks. Drinks took about 20 minutes to come out. By then we were a little annoyed but still, we are pretty easy to please and understanding (industry gals), and they were busy for a Tuesday night.
All right y'all this is where it gets fun. Our server takes our FULL ORDER, complimenting us on what we've chosen. Tables around us get sat, we ask for a wine list.. Tables around us get food... We're still waiting on our wine list.
Finally, we get a list.. select a bottle. 15 mins go by we get our bottle... we're drinking a whiiiiiiiiile..
and then,
OUR SERVER ASKS IF WE ARE READY TO ORDER DINNER. I'm sorry, what? We've already been waiting over an hour for our apps. Said server asks us to repeat what we initially ordered. Chef comes out and apologizes.. it never got put in. They didn't put in the dang order. What the H-E DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS!! At this point, we're about to break up with each other after six long years cause we're hangry. Our relationship has lasted so many ups and downs but not this got dang service y'all. So we leave, our drinks comped (duh) and will probably never come back. Go to McDonald's, you'll honestly get better service.

A few tips:
1. Always start with the bread and salted butter.
2. Order the burrata.
3. Order the bolognese.
4. Eat EVERYTHING! (This goes without saying.)
If the patio is open I highly recommend sitting outside - it's magical with fairy lights strung all around and there are heaters and blankets if you get chilly. However, they also have multiple beautiful spaces inside so there's really no bad seat in the house.
My SINGLE criticism is I've tried a few of their desserts - most recently the goat cheese cheesecake and a panna cotta drizzled with olive oil - and I haven't been especially impressed. To be honest I don't usually make it to dessert here anyway so it hasn't been a huge issue for me but if you have a sweet tooth I would recommend checking going elsewhere (Ballard is FILLED with great dessert spots, I recommend Hot Cakes).",,,

We had a reservation at 7pm and were seated promptly at near the front of the restaurant. San Fermo is located in a small White House in Ballard Ave and has a very cozy feeling! Although we were there for restaurant week, we couldn't resist ordering the charcuterie board and the buratta. Both are must orders if you're visiting. From restaurant week, I had the ceasar salad, spaghetti bolognese and the panna cotta! The bolognese was phenomenal and seems to be an overall favorite. It's also on the regular menu almost daily.
Besides the wonderful food, the service was a highlight. Our waitress was just not knowledgeable about the food but gave wonderful recommendations for wine. Try to Cupertino if you ever visit!
I will for sure be visiting in the future",,,

Saffron Spaghetti Bolognese - pork, veal, rosemary, fennel, parmigiano reggiano
Unreal flavor from the first bite to the last!
Agnolotti del Plin - prosciutto cotto and goat cheese filling, nutmeg, culatta
These flavor-packed pillows were my favorite! Amazing flavor and texture
Short Ribs - saffron polenta, cinnamon, cloves, fried leeks, Demi glac茅
The meat fell off of the bone and the polenta was a perfect match!
Bruschetta - smoked rockfish, squid ink aioli, pickled peppers, lemon oil
The smoked rockfish was SO FRESH and had wonderful flavors!

Smothered with fresh cheese and the anchovies had a nice salty taste!",,,

Oakland, CA","While walking around Ballard and considering dinner options, my friend Joe and I walked past this cute Italian restaurant and checked out the menu. The top item on the Primi & Secondi menu caught both our eyes and we had to get some.
Built onto what used to be a house, there is the intimate front room, a gorgeous patio, and a deep back room as well. I feel all have their pros and cons, so if an option take the back patio, but sitting in the front room and seeing the open kitchen is also a treat.
The menu is robust enough so that anyone could find something, while not being so overwhelming.
From the Antipasti my friend and I decided to split the House Caesar. Really tasty! I really appreciated the whole anchovies that really added to the experience and made you know this place was legit.
While the crab risotto and grilled pork belly did catch my eye, we both got our own Saffron Spaghetti Bolognese. I love saffron, I haven't had good spaghetti in a while, and the mix of pork and veal really called to me. What we got was this beautiful plate of spaghetti covered in sauce and then with a wonderful layer of white cheese. It was very flavorful, and while the bowl isn't huge, the amount of food is deceptively filling. My friend Joe even had some he took for lunch the next day.
All in all a great experience from the staff to the ambiance to the meal itself. I would gladly come back whether with friends, on a date, or even on my own.",,,

This time we had a reservation at 9:30 pm made on opentable but when we arrived the sign out front of the restaurant said that it was closed. We ventured forth and went in and the hostess hadn't realized we were on the reservation list I guess, but she agreed to seat us and said that it wasn't a problem. Our server was very friendly this time. He never once seemed rushed and we were able to enjoy our meal and a lovely bottle of wine without feeling like we were an inconvenience to the staff. The pasta's were incredible again. The pasta with short rib and blue cheese was ultra indulgent. This time the chefs even gave us a complimentary dessert before we left, some sort of mousse that was delicious. What a change the service made to our experience this visit.

San Fermo,(206) 342-1530,"Shanna L.
Los Angeles, CA","First time here. 2.5 stars but rounding down for the reasons noted below.
San Fermo is situated in an incredibly charming house turned restaurant. The interior decor is warm, both in terms of vibe and temperature. We thankfully were able to sit outside for our meal because it was uncomfortable inside -- and the patio was lovely.
The food here is pretty good - but not sensational, and painfully overpriced for what it is.
We ordered 1 appetizer, 1 salad, and 2 entrees (the cheaper of the available options) -- and no drinks -- and spent approximately $100 out the door. That should raise your eyebrows.
Portions are astoundingly small in relation to the price. San Fermo seems to want to go toe-to-toe with the worst aspects of dining in Manhattan, despite being situated in Ballard. That said, I've had way more satisfying Italian meals in Manhattan at this price point...
$14 for one piece of burrata. Menu description suggests it is accompanied by a wondrous array of vegetables and flavors, conjuring images of a satisfying spread. It wasn't much more than thoughtfully assembled, surely with culinary forceps. Didn't even come with a small piece of crostini, literally. See picture.
$14 (I think) for a nectarine salad. Nectarine *wedges* were huge, and were barely dressed or accompanied by the other items listed that we looked forward to (basil, endive, mozzarella - for example) and so tasted more like a fruit plate than anything else.
Now for the entrees: got the Bolognese (which the waitress touted as the restaurant's most popular dish) and a squid pasta dish (I'm forgetting the exact name). The flavor profile of the Bolognese was not nearly as sophisticated as I would have hoped given its popularity. It really lacked any underlying element of freshness and was heavy and monotonous. It was also lukewarm at best when finally delivered to our table (see below). That said, the squid pasta was excellent and truly offered a window into what San Fermo can do extraordinarily well.
Again, very small portions in relation to the price. It's not just small plates and small amounts of pasta. San Fermo doesn't even give you the protein item you expect in your pasta in any meaningful way. The particles of pork/veal were indiscernible vis-a-vis the sauce in the Bolognese and were largely indistinguishable. And there were only tiny squid ringlets. The amount of protein in both dishes was laughable, especially at $22-24 each.
I'd say their entrees, relative to other similarly situated Italian restaurants in Seattle, are approximately 25% - 33% higher.
Worst of all, we waited nearly *FORTY-FIVE* minutes between the time we finished our first course and received our pastas. The waitress was unapologetic and made it seem like this was just a reality of their restaurant, attributing it to the size of the kitchen. If that's the case, do not come here hungry. The last thing you should experience in any restaurant is a feeling of palpable hunger.
Everyone around us had already received their food. It felt like they forgot our order and didn't own up to it, which is unfortunate given that it's a relatively small restaurant with a relatively small menu.
The waitress told us that it would be another 10 minutes (ended up being closer to 20) and handed us a what was probably half a sliced baguette as a consolation about 30-35 minutes into the wait, even though we didn't want it earlier when she offered it (that's another $5, by the way). A more genuine gesture in light of the circumstances would have been to offer a primi or a glass of wine on the house. Didn't happen, and clearly management either wasn't involved or wasn't concerned.
There is an automatic service charge on your meal - and the service reflects that. Our waitress did not refill our water even once. We had to flag her down at every turn; she maybe visited our table four times of her own initiative, twice for greeting/taking our order and once for (expeditiously) bringing and returning the bill: the only fast part of the experience - a telltale sign. (Someone else brought our food.)
The most insidious part: San Fermo assesses their service charge BEFORE assessing tax, whereas most restaurants imposing a service charge do so as a separate item in lieu of gratuity. So, you pay tax on your tip, too. And the lackluster service was the cherry on top.
Sadly, we were here for a special occasion. The restaurant knew that in advance based on the reservation and even called my fianc茅 beforehand -- and they did absolutely nothing to enhance the experience.
We genuinely felt awful leaving the restaurant, despite the fact that it was supposed to be a celebration. We just moved to the neighborhood and were really hoping to love (and frequent) this place. Alas...",,,

Friend and I got a glass of wine each, the endive salad, the carbonara, and the bolognese. The endive salad was fresh, crisp, and ideally acidic to work our appetite up. I loved the bite of the carbonara. The bolognese was just perfection in every bite. That meat sauce was complex and smokey and chunky and ahhhhh I don't even know what adjectives to use. If you eat meat, you HAVE to get this.
And yeah, the ambiance is quite cute and romantic, especially in the attic (roomy and airy, don't worry). But I am desperate enough to just go there alone to devour an entire thing of bolognese.",,,

We got a corner table in the attic. Even though, I said the word attic, trust me, it doesn't feel like an attic. I like their light fixtures up there.
Their menu rotate daily with a couple of staple dishes.I ordered one of their staple dish, the spaghetti bolognese. My boyfriend ordered some kind of a seafood stew dish, like a cioppino. For appetizers, we ordered their antipasto board and got their bread and whipped butter dish (which is pretty good). The antipasto board had high quality meats and cheese and we were pretty happy with it.
I really liked my spaghetti dish, they made it really well. It was flavorful and the pasta was the perfect texture. My boyfriend liked his dish as well, but I think he wished he ordered pasta instead. I mean it is an Italian restaurant!
Overall, the service was great, pretty attentive. Great spot for Italian food in an intimate atmosphere.",,,

Seattle, WA","Our expectations were a bit higher for this lovely house restaurant with access to the Sunday market fresh vegetables and proteins. We're a bit disappointed in a the dishes we've tried so far.
Specifically the egg sandwich with arugula salad and the pasta dish (and I added a poached egg). The sandwich had more bread than filling and we found that a bit off putting even though the egg was nicely cooked and rich in of itself. The sandwich needed more protein to stand up to the richness of the egg, the thick bread, and the spicy arugula.
I had the pasta dish and while it was a good dish, I was not blown away by it like I thought I would be. It was a tad, bland. I wanted to like the dish much more but it was just ""good enough"".
The drinks were made well. We liked the mimosas and in fact ordered two each because they were really delightful for a sunny Sunday brunch. There is a bar here, and perhaps next time we just stop in for a drink or two.
One cool thing about the menu is that it changes weekly with only a couple items that remain as staples. Perhaps these dishes just weren't for us. We have visited twice now and have walked away wanting. We'll probably give the food one last try and if it's not great, we won't return.",,,

Seattle, WA","I've always said that I don't love Italian food. This is a personal thing I am dealing with it. I enjoy Italian food but I hardly ever crave it.
That being said, I have to admit I really did love this place. First things first, this place is really quite expensive. The pastas are easily $8-10 more than other places that also offer handmade noodles and sauces. However, the place is super cute (ideal for date night) and each room feels unique. The service is warm, kind and extremely helpful.
I really did love the quality of the pastas and sauce. The bolognese was great. I've had a lot of truly great bolognese and I really enjoyed this one. The dungeness crab bucatini was exquisite. A lot of seafood pastas will overload on garlic or cream to mask the not so fresh seafood but this let the crab shine. It had the right amount of lemon, butter and crushed black pepper to make a perfectly simple yet extremely delicious plate of pasta.
Also, I need to mention the Caesar salad. Wow. I love Caesar salads and I appreciate when they are anchovy forward (it is a fishy dressing, afterall). This was perfectly dressed with a wonderfully salty, fishy, anchovy-y dressing that will leave me thinking about it for some time. One of my favorite Caesar salads in the city, hands down.",,,

Dallas, TX","Two takeaways from last night- they aren't as kid friendly as they claim to be and they aren't receptive to feedback regarding their service and will get defensive (so be ready for that).
Without getting into the details some of the lowlights were:
1. We placed our order @ 5:45 pm and didn't get our main courses until 6:30 pm
2. The waitress didn't visit our table to ask how the salad tasted or to see how things were going
3. After we ate the salad the waitress removed the plates and drink glass without asking if my husband wanted to drink something else (note he was in the bathroom with our son but didn't bother to circle back)
4. After I pointed this out to the owner about several minutes later (when he walked by) he got super defensive
5. They gave us bread to accommodate my two years old son asking about his pasta but then proceeded to take away most of the plates (and the bread) and left my son with a spoon to finish his pasta (because at this point I guess they wanted us to leave)
They've definitely lost a customer that would normally eat at San Ferno monthly. Note that adding a chair to a two seater isn't really going out of your way to accommodate a situation and pointing out several times that your customers complained about my son wasn't kid friendly.

And to your right is a small town of seating, and there are more seating further in the ""house"" as well. The staff are friendly, but not overly so - you'll be left alone to enjoy your meal except for drink refills when necessary. I would recommend the burrata - very soft, fresh, light, and well complemented by the sweet & tart flavors of the diced apple plus balsamic vinegar. Additionally, the light and citric acid flavors of the burrata dish goes well with their housemade focaccia bread. I would also recommend the spaghetti bolognese. It's creamier than the typical bolognese sauce with savory and hearty pork + veal in each bite. For dessert, I tried their tiramisu. It's quite uniquely flavored with pumpkin mascarpone and cinnamon - personally, I wasn't a big fan of the dense texture of the mascarpone as the bottom layer of the tiramisu or the cinnamon mixed with cocoa powder flavor.

I once again got the Cacio e Pepe, remembering how good it was from a few years ago, and it was, again... fine, as well as the artichoke appetizer, also fine. It was VERY salty -- so if consuming salt is an issue, this isn't the appetizer for you.

Seattle, WA","My boyfriend and I stopped here for a late dinner and were pleased to find that their kitchen was still open at 10pm. We got the chicken liver mousse bruschetta to start and shared the bucatini and fennel sausage pizza. He got a whiskey sour with egg whites (extra $2, though he thought it was worth it to take the drink from $9 to a reasonable $11), and I got the Sicilian bramble, which was just a delightfully refreshing drink. Nice and fruity but not fake tasting - an ideal balance.
I loved the bruschetta. First of all, it was served with 4 large pieces of fluffy bread. The bread was perfectly done - crisp crust that wasn't so hard it would cut the roof of your mouth and soft inside. I usually expect some measly little crostinis or small pieces of baguette at nicer places like this. To match the thickness of the bread, there was a thick layer of mousse on top as well, making this actually quite a large and filling dish.
The bucatini was a little too al dente for our taste, and I typically enjoy my pasta al dente. Just maybe a wee bit less al dente. The sauce was good though, albeit a little salty, especially considering how salty guanciale already is. When we finished the pasta, the waitress suggested that we keep the leftover sauce to dip the pizza crust in, and my mind was blown. I feel like it's usually the opposite situation - where I want to keep the sauce on the plate but it's swept away before I can say anything.
The pizza was also a hefty serving. The sausage wasn't too salty and was very tasty. The crust was a little soft, but overall the pizza was delicious. We were both very happy with the meal, the service, and the restaurant overall. They also had a great playlist going on.",,,

Definitely not worth $23 for this. When we mentioned to the server the pasta was undercooked and hard inside she could care less. The Pizza was good. Our roasted cauliflower appetizer tasted like store bought slaw and was served cold.,,,

The fried polenta gnocchi (my fav dish), the fried risotto with ragu, the two pastas, and the two pizzas we tried were all worth the splurge. Everything was well seasoned and perfectly prepared. We also tried the fresh beans with ricotta and pistachios, and fried artichokes - both were delicious. The salad was a large serving of very fresh greens. Even with all that, we also ordered a dessert to share. I can't stop talking about the warm pumpkin cake with spiced pecans, sauce and ice-cream. We all went nuts. And it was large enough for all five of us to have a couple of bites each - all we could manage considering the feast we just consumed. The service was as good as the food. What a fun and delicious meal.",,,

Seattle, WA","Over the past few years, the food and service at this place has declined significantly, which makes me sad as I used to frequent quite often.
Went last night for the first time in about a year (after tossing in the towel) with some friends who suggested it ... we hoped that things had improved. Nope.
After waiting at our table for more than 10 minutes, we finally asked a passing employee whether we had a server and she my goodness has he not been by ... nope. She then at that moment kindly took our drink and appetizer order.
Our server showed up with the wine and made no apology or any acknowledgment that he left us hanging for so long at the outset. He then proceeded to be snarky throughout service.
Wine was fine. Artichokes were over salted and had very little pangratto. The fried risotto with beef ragu and mozzarella was good.
The winter squash ravioli downright bad and was sent back ... predominantly muddy flour water taste ... bizarre for a dish of the type I order frequently.
Both the carbonara and cacio et pepe pastas lacked flavor and tasted watered down. The guanciale in carbonara was chewy, bloated and unrendered.
The Amatriciana pasta was good after a friend doctored it up with her own calabrian chili oil for more flavor.
Ordered baguette with olive oil after an extended discussion with server about whether we wanted focaccia ... focaccia arrived anyway ... didn't see the bill but we indicated we didn't want it and they told us to keep it anyway ... too much honey in the butter according a friend who tried it.
Much better Italian in the area ...",,,

Seattle, WA","Another great Italian/pasta place! Went on a Monday evening and was immediately seated. We got the fried artichokes as an appetizer. It was solid and the aioli was pretty good. For the main dishes we got the hot coops pizza and the carbonara. The pizza was wood fire and delicious. The toppings went well together and it was a good size for one hungry person or two to share. The carbonara was excellent and a huge portion. The pasta was cooked al dente and the egg yolk on top made it even creamier and elevated the texture. It definitely could have used a little bit more salt or seasoning, but it was still delicious. The service is great and our waitress was very friendly and nice. Will definitely be returning and will be part of our Italian/pasta rotation.",,,

I love that their menu has a wide variety of fresh, fried, grilled, and everything in between. Many things on the menu i had never heard of, such as fried gnocchi --i love finding new things! I did not get any of the pastas or pizzas this time, but will definitely be back to try both with friends, as one serving of either is quite large!
The staff is very friendly, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. At the tables were large families, couples on dates, friends. There were also some individual people at the bar just reading, and I love a place where I can feel comfortable just to come alone if I want. I also loved the painted pink flowers in the restroom and the painting of cakes, yum! Thank you Ethan Stowell, for another restaurant to add to my happy hour and dinner list :)

Food was a more sophisticated than gh pasta co. Just enough for me to want to keep going back to both. Gh for a quick lunch and le messe for a casual dinner.
We got the wine pairing and the four course tasting menu. They let us customize a little and 4 courses turned out to be 4 courses per person so for two you actually get to try 8 different dishes.

Rainbow carrots, fennel crab salad and tomato salad. Every single one of them is so tasty and we absolutely loved every bit of it.

Bellevue, WA","We all have restaurants that we keep coming back to, even if they are a distance away. Le Messe is that place for me.
My first visit was due to a need for pasta and my experience there did not disappoint. So even though I live in the Eastside, I find ways to come back.
My favorite experience is at the chef's counter where they have special items you can't get anywhere else at the restaurant. That where I went my first time and I fell in love. Probably is the place I had bucatini for the first time.
This trip I did the tasting and I believe I am a better person because of it. This is coming from a person who is not picky but is not the biggest fan of someone else choosing their food options. But at least they were kind enough to ask about my allergies and preferences.
The highlights (there weren't any lowlights but these stood out to me:
The zucchini salad and the bread dish was so good, I forgot to take pictures of them .
The steak as the meat course was fantastic. The
The cooked salmon was by far one of the best dishes I ever had. Not only because I could cut the fish with my fork, but because of that skin. It was the right level of crispy goodness that I was heartbroken when I finished it.
And the pasta was fantastic of course. And it was made better by the great service.
Caveat: You can not rely on the website to see what the current offerings are. Which means the items are made fresh, but don't have your heart set on the something you saw on their site as there are not up to date.
But with the food I had, I wasn't definitely wasn't disappointed. Though I wish they were on the Eastside",,,

Kitsilano, Vancouver, Canada","I had a wonderful experience at Le Messe for Seattle restaurant week. Their interior is simple and beautiful. Definitely looks like a fancy restaurant, they have a high table area that surrounds their kitchen so you could choose to sit there and watch them cook. We didn't do that since we were a group of four and that would've been hard to have a conversation.
They do an AMAZING Beef Tartare. This is a must get item; the bread that the tartare is on top of comes warmed and toasty and the flavor of the beef is spot on. I think it was my favorite of the night!
Their smoked fish is also super good, comes on warm toasted bread as well and I would highly recommend trying it.
Other than that, we had their grilled halibut and pork. Their proteins are cooked to perfection as well with wonderful components to their dish that provides great textures and flavors.
They didn't have any pasta on their SRW menu but I hope to come back to try them because it all looks amazing!
We tried their dessert and we were at first skeptical of the triple cheese dessert but the honey and cheese and almonds was a surprisingly wonderful mix! They had homemade gelato as well and that was delicious! Their chocolate mousse was my favorite, it came with candied orange and flaky sea salt on the top. So creamy and smooth and chocolatey :p
Our server was very helpful and patient with us as we kept talking and forgot to look at the menu at the beginning!",,,

They make their pasta right in the restaurant. Menu have French sounding names but let me describe, Dungeness crab pasta is a must try. And the other one is similar to ravioli with taste of a burst of lime, and basil and mushrooms and parmesan cheese and it was excellent. Service was amazing and let your server educate you on what is best and what is on the menu if you are a first timer. Price is fairly reasonable for the ambiance, service and selections. Don't forget to try their dessert menu! We had what they call warm ice cream / yogurt drizzled in pistachios and it was the best!",,,

Seattle, WA","It was the first time trying Le Messe. One of my favorite cuisines is Italian food and pasta, so I was excited to have dinner here.
We ordered the hamachi crudo to start (this was light and refreshing). And for our entree's, we ordered the tagliatelle, which had Dungeness crab, creme fraiche, celery, and chives. And also the bucatini, with chanterelle, oregano, parmigiano, and egg yolk. Unfortunately I couldn't try the tagliatelle because I'm allergic to crab. But my bucatini was pretty tasty. The egg yolk definitely makes all the difference in making the dish creamy and rich. It's one of my favorite Italian dishes to have. We also ordered some bread, which was $5.
The food was pretty good, at least, what I was able to try. But overall, nothing really stood out to me where I would want to return for more.
The service could've been a little better. Our server seemed nice but very robotic. He didn't really come to check on us as often as he probably should've. Didn't really give us any recommendations for both dinner and dessert. He just came to take our order, bring our food, clean our table, and bring our check. Sadly, our dining experience here was just, alright.
If you don't mind dry service, I would at least check out the food here. We might've ordered things that weren't their specialty/popular. But for us, the food wasn't bad; it just wasn't amazing.",,,

Bellevue, WA","I'm not an expert in Italian food, came here for a birthday party because we need a nice restaurant for an excuse to dress up. Our party was 18 people deep, the bill was about $600 total after tax and tip, so for about $30 a head, it wasn't a bad experience. The menu changes every day depending on what they have that day. The entrees here were one of those smaller portion, artistic dishes, pleasing for the eye to look at type of deal. It's pasta so after so many pasta dishes, it does fill you up. My favorite was the agnolotti, it had the best flavor and I love mushrooms in general.
The restaurant is medium size, but spacious with the option to sit at the chef's table where you can watch them cook. They are only open for dinner 5-10pm daily. Perfect for date nights, girls night out, or business dinner. Located at a corner, parking was easy enough during this hour, but then again I did got a parking ticket since after a certain time you have to have a permit, but that's my fault for not reading signs right.

Seattle, WA","Despicable experience. Made reservations ahead. Arrived and were welcomed as if it was a surprise borderline inconvenient. The first draw back is the noise. It was so loud we couldn't have a basic face to face conversation. We proceeded to order wine from our charismatic friendly waiter. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. It took 90 minutes! 90 minutes to get a cold fennel crab flake salad. Still wonder if the crab was just a garnish on the menu to appease novice critics. The second appetizer never came and by the time we got our pasta dish we had been seated for 2 hours.
We could have left, mind you. Complained even. BUT this was Saturday night. The only break we get from our 50h+ shifts/week. We just wanted to remain positive and make the best of our special evening. The manager we suspect generated a form of apology when he delivered the bill because they overcharged us for food we never received and the ""wonky"" Saturday they were having. So now not only did I lose 2 hours of my life I can not get back, but I also need to feel bad for an overpriced botched dinner experience too!? How absurd!
Lesson learned: next time. We will order $100 worth of fresh organic local food, have it delivered, fix our own gourmet dinner and swear off dining out for that Seattle's dining has become a complete scam where profit drives the least scrupulous ones and where pride in your work is an art/virtue of the past.",,,

Seattle, WA","An airy, light-filled, Italian restaurant.
Everything was ordered from their Happy Hour menu (daily 5-6p & 9-10p, bar only).
For starters, we had a dozen of their daily oysters, which were the Purple Mountains from Hood Canals. We also ordered the Ahi Crudo, Springs Greens, and Beef Tartare. The ahi crudo was delicious, with a fresh citrus taste and a good sprinkle of coarse salt. I also loved the spring greens which came with a huge mound of parmesea, so good. The tartare was okay and only came out with three pieces of small toast.
For mains, we ordered the daily fish (Halibut), daily steak (Snake River Zabuton), and the Squid Ink Spaghetti. The fish was delicate and delicious, cooked perfectly. The steak came out medium-rare, with more emphasis on rare. I thoroughly enjoyed both of these dishes. However, I thought the squid ink spaghetti was lackluster and under-seasoned. We did not order it with the extra bottarga (salted, cured fish roe). In hindsight we definitely should have but since our waiter did not mention anything about it. On a positive note, there was a lot of spaghetti.
Overall, I liked most of these dishes. I did notice that the portions seemed small (particularly for the tartare and daily steak, which had 4 slices). Maybe since all dishes were from the HH menu. The service was also just okay.",,,

WA, WA","Went to Le Messe last night; four of us ordered the Four-Course Tasting Menu. Here's the rundown of what we got:
App 1. Beets w/oil-cured olives and Marcona almonds in a vinaigrette: Very tasty.
App 2. Hamachi Crudo (Hamachi fish, served raw) with shaved kumquat, chilis, and celery: Good, but a bit too mild in flavor.
App 3. Fresh mozzarella slices topped with some kind of chunky orange-red sauce (not sure what it was): this was my least favorite dish -- pretty blah, under-salted, and the flavor and appearance of the orangey-red stuff on top of the cheese was utterly unidentifiable; the only thing I could identify were some mustard seeds. I didn't care for this dish much.
App 4. Delicata Squash with Rapini and black olive: the squash was delicious, but the rapini was pretty bitter, even for rapini.
App 5. Salad of leaf lettuce with candied pecans, freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and balsamic vinaigrette. Very tasty.
Pasta 1. Cacio e Pepe Pasta (rigatoni w/cheese and pepper) with actual/real white truffle (not ""truffle oil""): Very delicious! Given that (I believe) they make their pasta fresh every day, I expected a more delicately-textured pasta. It was a little on the thicker, sturdier side, which wasn't a bad thing - it's just that I wasn't expecting that. However, it was fully cooked, yet remained al dente. I actually liked the chewier texture. The sauce is made of Pecorino Romano and black pepper -- with the added bonus of white truffle -- and served with more grated cheese on top - yummy!!!
Pasta 2. Agnolotti (a stuffed pasta) that was filled with short rib, served with Delicta squash and either hazelnuts or Marcona almonds. Very delicious.
Protein 1. Sea Scallops, with parsnip-and-celery root puree, and fried parsnip chips, in Salmoriglio (a Southern Italian condiment made of lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, chopped oregano and parsley, salt, and pepper). Good, but not great in my opinion. The scallops seemed to be properly cooked, with a good sear on at least one side, but it seemed under-seasoned, and something in the dish tasted a little bitter.
Protein 2. Short Ribs. I loved them, but I'm very partial to short ribs, so I may not be very objective. Everyone seemed to like them, but maybe not as much as I did.
Dessert 1. Chocolate Brownie, with sea salt, whipped cream, almonds, and a raspberry sauce: Good; the sea salt made it better.
Dessert 2. Mascarpone Cake with roasted (or poached?) plums and whipped cream. Good.
It's a small restaurant, but when we got there (5:30) it was still fairly empty, so it wasn't noisy. However, a large group that arrived a little later was seated next to us, and they were very noisy. The d茅cor is all hard surfaces, so it was very loud. This is a downside, in my opinion.
Also, we were there for a long time - over 3 hours. So, the hard bench seat we were sitting on was getting pretty hard by then, if you know what I mean. Fortunately, we didn't get any dirty looks or vibes indicating that we really needed to move along, and I appreciate that. (I was keeping an eye on the host station to see if people were waiting to be seated, and I never saw that happen, so I guess we lucked out.)
When we're in the mood for pasta, we'll put this place on our list of options, so we may well come back some time. But I'm not feeling that ""I've just GOT to come back again for sure!"" In other words, we all enjoyed our food (every dish went back to the kitchen completely empty) and we were satisfied with our experience, but it didn't send me over the moon.",,,

The chicken fajitas came with red onion, bell pepper, rice, black beans, 3 tortillas, sour cream, guacamole and pico de gallo. If you're hungry, get this because it is a ton of food and all of it is delicious! Whoever is in the kitchen is paying attention, because the chicken is cut into thin strips, which is easy for assembling and eating on those homemade flour tortillas.

It was really good, the chip were crispy and crunchy. Their salsa tasted a little different from what I usually get when I go to Mexican restaurant. It look more like a paste like Indian curry. It was good though. We got our food out. The nacho portion was huge. I do have to admit that my fish taco or my friend chicken fajitas it tasted good, but the spotlight go to their Nachos! It was delicious. I don't know what sauce did they marinated the chicken with or whatsoever. It tasted amazing.
Next time when I come here again. I'm just going to get their nachos for my main entree. One of the dish people should have when they come here. They do have happy hour as well as Tuesday & Saturday taco for just for $2. Overall, great place to be and friendly service as well.",,,

Waipahu, HI","We ate here a second time. I got the 3 fish tacos and a corona, and wife got carne asada, rice, and a coke. Food was the same as before. Portion size is pretty good--- 3 tacos for $11 is very reasonable considering that it was decently filling. I did notice that I didn't care for one of the dressings on the tacos. It tasted like vinaigrette and made the tacos a bit too sour. But the fish was delicious and cooked perfectly. My wife's carne was pretty good. Very tender and simply flavored.
Our waitress was nice and on-point. However, paying $6 for a regular size bottle of corona is pretty crazy.... Shoot my beer was about the same cost as my wife's carne and rice.",,,

Seattle, WA","I've been here three times now - for happy hour, during lunch and also on the weekend. I would say that happy hour and weekends are quietest and during the lunch hour is busy! Lots of people coming in for a quick bite or to-go lunches. The restaurant is also awkwardly laid out in my opinion, with the kitchen in the middle; the bar and seating on one side and the dining room on the other. You have to walk across the kitchen to get to the other side. But anyway...
Each time I've ordered different drinks and specials. Even though they have a happy hour menu AND taco Tuesday, what they don't have is cocktails or an assortment of happy hour DRINK specials. Don't expect to pay a lot less during happy hour for drinks because at max - some beers are $1 off. Boo~ The food is also... decently priced for happy hour except you get less! So you're not actually getting the full-sized version of the food; you're just paying less - to eat less which is a bummer.
For example, I got the happy hour ceviche that comes with 2 tacos... for $10; whereas the regular appetizer sized ceviche is 3 tacos... for $15. Once again, boo ~
Anyway - the actual drinks and food itself is great! I think the tacos, ceviche and pina colada are all delicious! The margaritas come with slushy ice (which may or may not be your taste). The portions are relatively decent - I can eat an order of tacos (3 flour tacos) and be full for lunch without anything else. They really load up the toppings on the tacos and my fav so far is the steak! Chips and salsa are not free for lunch - just a warning; but they're not expensive to order (I think it's $3?).
Overall, service is decent... it's a hit or miss depending on the time you go. I find that when it's BUSY - there's no one waiting on our table and when it's quieter, there's a lot more attentive service. The bartender is also nice enough to go around and wait on tables which is nice. I find the location also convenient for SLU but honestly; I've also had better Mexican food. I would take off one star for the bad pricing (and lack of specials or ""better pricing"" during HH); and also take off one star for the awkward layout and service.",,,

Seattle, WA","Came here with a girlfriend after a class at CycleBar nearby for taco Tuesday! This restaurant is located in a quieter part of SLU and I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated right away on what is probably their most popular night. The space itself is homey and has a very laidback vibe. It's also a huge place, divided into a main dining room and a back bar area.
They have a pretty extensive list of tacos for taco Tuesday (fried cod, steak, chicken tinga, nopales, cantinas) and they're each $2!! I tried the cod, steak, and carnitas. My favorite was definitely the carnitas! The pork was cooked perfectly and the marinated onions were SO good. The cod was my second favorite, and the steak was my least favorite. It was still good, just not something that blew me away. Three tacos was definitely enough to satisfy me- these things were pretty hefty. This will likely become a common Tuesday night spot for me, and the happy hour menu looks great too!",,,

Got in late on a Tuesday like 8pm, there wasn't many folks in there at the time, bar area. Perfect low lit, good service, good food. I ordered the enchiladas with Chorizo, wow so good. You can tell fresh chorizo and well made tortillas. Just mmm good, definitely coming back for more of these. Girlfriend got the red sauce burrito with Asada meat, OMG it was huge and so tasty. She got a Michelada as well and their mix was pretty good.
Overall service was good.
Food was really great.
Not to busy, good atmosphere and vibe.
I really liked this place. Portion sizes could have been a bit bigger at lease on the enchilada side. Tortillas were a bit hard on the edges and couldn't cut through. Other than that, could be 5 star place easy.",,,

Seattle, WA","Awesome Taqueria! All of the food we tried was amazingly delicious!
As someone who lives and works in South Lake Union, there are definitely not enough Mexican restaurants in the area. I had seen this place keep popping up via other friends so decided to try it out.
I was not disappointed, and was delightfully impressed!
The service was great, very attentive and very friendly! There are other restaurants in the area that lack a bit in the customer service because of the guaranteed business flow, so it was nice to be treated so well here!
The food was exceptional! We started with nachos for the table, and they are definitely some of the better nachos that I have had in a while! For entrees, our table got a variety from enchiladas, tacos, fajitas, and everyone was more than happy with their choice!
All of the meat was well seasoned and cooked just right! After only being here one time, it is fair to say that it is hard to make a bad decision here!
The prices are all reasonable and affordable! They are cheaper than other restaurants in the area but you get better service and good portions!
It seems like they have a good special for both happy hour and taco Tuesday! I will definitely be going back and will post an updated review!
If you are having troubles deciding what to get, try the fajitas or get the enchiladas with half of each sauce!
Cheers!",,,

Seattle, WA","First time here today, stopped by for taco Tuesday! The location is very small but you are seated quickly since the food is quick. Had the prickly pear margarita and a couple tacos. It was DELICIOUS!
I often consider myself a taco enthusiast and am constantly on the search for a good taco. Especially in Seattle! Something I often encounter is the cost of the tacos vs the substance. You'll find a lot of street tacos that cost $12+ for two! Which can be ridiculous.
I had the chicken & steak tacos. Both were incredible with so much flavor! The chicken were covered in a fantastic sauce. Fresh, good portions, and exactly my kind of tacos! Plus on Tuesday's after 4pm it's $2 a taco. Can't beat that!
All the tacos except the fish are gf and so are the nachos! Didn't ask about anything else on the menu though.

Because this location had really good food, they had an authentic mexican vibe and the large amount of customers tells me they are a good place. However, when we arrived we sat down and were asked if we can move to another location so that they could fit larger groups at our table. We were completely understanding even when they moved us to a small corner. But when they sat two girls at our table I was annoyed.

Seattle, WA","Great taqueria in the middle of downtown. It's spacious and is very brightly colored! Tables are not squished together which is a welcome change from the usual Seattle setup. There's a seating area as you enter, and you can do further in to find more seating and a bar.
I'm here often for lunch, and the food is consistently good. They have a vegetarian option with each offering: tacos, burritos and enchiladas. Their cactus tacos with crema is delicious, and you get 2 or 3 which is a decent portion size, and they do taco Tuesdays. Beware the size of the burritos, they're humongous and do me well for one and half or even two meals.
My favorite thing on their menu however is their habanero salsa which is amazing. The nachos are easily some of the best I've had in downtown Seattle. They are thicker than usual and salted generously and peppy, and pairs well with the salsa and guacamole.
The bar makes a decent margarita. They're also open late: until 2 am on some days, so it's ideal if you're looking for some late night food and drinks.",,,

They have several different menu's including taco Tuesday, brunch , happy hours etc. The place has a great vibe and has lots of interior made in wood
The brunch menu is concise with options like breakfast burrito, chilaquiles , brioche sandwhiches. They also have dishes for your sweet tooth. We ordered the chilaquiles in habanero sauce and breakfast burrito in red sauce. The breakfast burrito was delicious , served piping hot and smothered with lots of their signature red sauce. We enjoyed it.
The chilaquiles on the other hand were more like egg nachos. All the tortilla chips were drenched in habanero sauce to the point of being uneatable due to the hotness. We also ordered their signature mimosa which was good.
Overall a good place , I would visit again to try their other dishes.",,,

Washington, DC","$2 Taco Tuesday is poppin' but El Grito is understaffed and the tacos are just average. It's not a bad spot to eat after work with coworkers / friends, especially if you're in SLU. The space is quite small and there aren't too many tables. You might have luck finding seats in the bar area, but over there seemed crowded too when I checked it out. One time I came here with some others and we ended up waiting so long, but the more frustrating part was that the hostess would not give us an accurate estimate. I also felt like I had to keep reminding her about us waiting.
Food-wise, the chips are seriously addicting but the guac and salsa are surprisingly expensive. The tacos come out family-style and arrived at our table soon after we ordered. I've tried the chicken, steak, pork, and cod. They're normal sized tacos so $2 is a sweet deal, even if they are the definition of mediocre.",,,

Seattle, WA","True to its name, this place serves up a mean sandwich! There are good restaurants, and then there are restaurants whose food is worthy of random cravings that could happen on any day at any time. Mean sandwich falls squarely in the latter category for me.
The Midnight At the Oasis, the falafel-based sandwich, is one of the best vegan sandwiches I've had anywhere. It simply can't be beet ;)
The chicken cutlet sandwich is SO delicious - it's the one I crave the most when I think of Mean Sandwich.
I've also had one bite of my friend's fish sandwich, which I found to be tasty with inventive flavors.
I'm not a huge fan of the potato skins and ins - I find them to be too crisp and browned for my tastes, but that won't keep me from coming back for the sandwiches (I do wish they offered an additional side dish option or two, though)!",,,

San Francisco, CA","We snuck into Mean Sandwich just before they were going to close for Thanksgiving week. So lucky us. Unluckily they were doing a fried chicken pop-up that same day and it was bonkers inside with lots of people and orders backed up in the kitchen. They did offer to send our food to the brewery next door if we chose to wait there instead but we decided to walk around the neighborhood and come back.
We ordered the steak tartare club and a side of salt and pepper 'skins and ins. It took about 35 minutes for our food. The steak tartare is labor intensive so due to the rush they were batching them as orders came in I think.
Worth it though! What an incredible idea to substitute steak tartare in spicy yuzu mayo for the T in the BLT. And with chewy dense rye bread. The sandwich doesn't look like much but I recommend sharing if you want to include a generous helping of skins as well.
Speaking of which, why has no one else thought about deep frying potato skins? Wonderfully salty, peppery, crispy with yummy soft potato insides. Dangerously addictive and filling. Goes great with beer :-).
Definitely want to come back and try the Midnight at the Oasis next time we're in town.",,,

The burger here is smashed to perfection with very crispy sides and juicy throughout. I'm not a fan of mustard or raw onions on a burger but boy, do they go well with this burger at Mean Sandwich. I'm a fan!
The ""fries"" are not really fries but fried potatoes with skin. I suspect they're baked first and then fried later: Whatever they do with them, they're quite magical :) Crispy skins with the meaty center in that spud.
If you've been to any Fredy's Steakhouse chain location, this is an elevated version of that kind of a burger.

San Diego, CA","Case of ordering wrong? Not sure. We actually made a u-turn to hit up this place to grab some lunch to go for our road trip up north. I always trust a local fav from yelp and the amount of patrons waiting for food further supported that. However, the combination of super long wait, high price and lackluster sandwiches have left me feeling a bit bitter abouts things.
I ordered the Buon Appetito (chicken cutlet sandwich) and the Jersey Sub (Italian sub) which are both $12. I thought it would be a quick process but the shop is small and it was very busy with orders going one at a time. It seemed like there was a combo of 4 or 5 people in the place ahead of me and who knows how many remote ordering. Pro tip (apparently) order ahead for pickup. I think my wait for 2 sandwiches was at least 25 mins.
Out of the 2, the Buon appetito was better, but still mediocre. But the Jersey was just plain bad. Whatever sub roll bread is used tasted like cheap white bread and was probably the primary reason it tasted badly... bread is important. It was just really plain tasting. I hate feeling so strongly on this but for nearly $30 for 2 sandwiches and being in a hurry, this visit was a big mistake and I should have just gotten sandwiches at Safeway for half the price.",,,

Seattle, WA","Spent the afternoon with a friend who suggested we come here for lunch. She told me she had been here before and that I would like it; she was spot on.
Mean Sandwich is a small shop in Ballard that has no frills. Featured in Bon Appetit's 2017 List of America's Best New Restaurants, which I was informed about by my friend, I was intrigued to find a pretty basic menu: 7 sandwiches with 3 daily specials (soup may be one), 1 salad, 3 kinds of fat potato skins: salt & pepper or buffalo sauce or loaded-cheese/chives/bacon bits/more cheese, and yesterday's bun bread pudding.
While my friend and I were staring at the menu trying to decide what to order, a member of BOH came out, started singing loudly along with the 80's song playing and a huge grin. ""What should I get?!"" belted out my friend. ""Buon Appetito,"" he replied. She gushed. He kept singing. She informed me I had to get the skins and share them with her, so we got the salt and pepper.
Buon Appetito is a chicken sandwich with buffalo mayo, provolone, tomato, lettuce, and a pickled pepper relish. It looked huge. It was. My bud ended up taking half the sandwich home for later.
I got the Jersey Sub: capicola, provolone, salami, ham, lettuce, tomato, oregano, oil & vinegar (I asked for no red onion). Amazingly good. Crazy filling. The BREAD, man, the bread. It was like home, only a home I've never had.
Their icon is a pair of lady's lips with red lipstick, and they had free stickers. We each grabbed one. I slapped mine on the back of my day planner which is now in the recycling bin somewhere, and I really, really want to go back and get another sticker. And a sandwich.
You can get delivery. You can get catering. Adult beverages are available. I stuck with a bottle of root beer.
Outdoor seating where your pooch can also sit is available. Tables indoors along with bar stools facing the windows.

Example of poor ratio: is The Fish is really good when you get the right bite and you get a bit of everything. However the sardines are like 10% of the sandwich. The bread is like 40% the sandwich and at times your just eating bread, which is also really good but I want something in between it. Also the fish is between.

The potato sides were also awesome. The part I really want to highlight though is Dan. When I asked what he recommended, he actually asked questions and gave great guidance. He also checked in on us to see if we were enjoying our sandwiches and asked what we thought of our selections. On our way out the door he thanked us for visiting.

Seattle, WA","Mean Sandwich is a high quality sandwich place in the south end of Seattle's Ballard. It serves a limited range of well-produced sandwiches.
The restaurant is in an easy location to reach near the bridge. Parking nearby is limited and we were lucky to find a space in relatively short walking distance. We had come for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy.
Inside there is a very limited set of seating. This is a place that probably works best for takeout, since I wouldn't have felt really confident we could sit down, and don't want to let my food get cold. Service was counter-style, and friendly.
The menu is very limited. I knew this going in, but when faced with the actual choices, there are really only two that appeal to me much and really only one I definitely want.
There is a very appealing sounding side (fried potato lumps called skins and ins). This is exactly the sort of thing I typically love, but it was a bit overcooked and oversalted and I liked it but didn't love it, which was the big disappointment of the visit. I had expected this to be the high point.
When the sandwich arrived, it was great quality. I had a Buon Appetito (chicken). The bread is super - which I think is what tends to be most important. Not too sweet or soft. Great bread. The filling was a bit less exciting. It tasted like pretty normal sandwich fare. Not bad in any way, but not amazing. The portions were giant. With the skins, both of us had about twice as much food as we needed for a lunch and should have shared (except that we wanted completely different things).
Overall, this is a pretty good sandwich place. Much better than most of the regular chains or local places. If something from their tiny selection appeals to you, I recommend a visit. I doubt we'll be going very often, because we didn't bond with the choices we made and there isn't much more we want to try.",,,

Seattle, WA","Corvus had been a favorite for drinks, food, and brunch. Reasonably priced, friendly service, and decent acoustics made this a quiet standout. But the last few times have been disappointing, and last night brought back an old gripe about the new waitstaff that has landed in the Puget Sound area: they aren't professional. We arrived in time for happy hour, and ordered food from it. We also ordered two cocktails -- the menu said ""ALL COCKTAILS $2 OFF."" The toddy was ok, a little heavy-handed with the dried spices, and the Last Word was unbalanced, with too much sour competing with the Luxardo and both overwhelming the chartreuse. I could have sent it back, but wasn't in the mood to be ""that guy."" Food was fine as always, especially the fried okra and chickpeas.
When the the bill arrived, it showed the HH for happy hour pricing, but not on the Last Word. I pointed out the wording on the menu, and the waitress told me she only works one night a week and to take it up with the management/owner. No further help from her. Her service was basic, nothing stellar, but that last comment showed how little she cared about customers and the restaurant. Typically I would have sought out management and voiced my concerns, but last night I just wanted to get on with my evening.
It is a small matter, but I hope management clarifies their drink policy or gives staff the ability to make things right.",,,

The menu is pretty extensive, so I ended up asking the server for a recommendation. I'm really not a huge fan of gin based drinks, but she assured me that the gin they use is very smooth and doesn't have an overpowering flavor. And she was right! My drink was fruity and very refreshing. I'll be back to try more!",,,

This place is definitely on a more casual side, and the vibes were in-between a bar & classy cocktail bar. The walls were open to the outside and the spot was happily filled, but not packed.
At first glance,the drinks were cheap, but they still had interesting inviting cocktails. My inner asian was screaming ""BEST VALUE"". My group got a variety of drinks and I was very impressed to say the least. There were definitely a few cocktails I'd love to try and I was very satisfied with what I got.
I'd definitely be back with some friends for a cocktail night out, and I'd love to explore the other drinks that are offered. I highly recommend checking this spot out for drinks!",,,

Redmond, WA","I've only been here for Sunday brunch with friends, so that is what I'm reviewing. I've been here a few times (but only started doing the check-in thing recently), and I've usually ordered the French toast. It's good stuff.
Yesterday, it seems that other customers thought the French toast was such good stuff that it was all gone by the time I arrived, just after 1 pm. The server suggested ""Australian unicorn toast"" as a substitute; it's the special of the day because it was the Australian bartender's birthday. It was a slice of thick toast, sliced diagonally, and served with whipped butter and syrup - pretty much the way French toast would be served, except without the egg batter coating. The portion size was too small, but it was only $3, so I ordered another portion. That was about right, and my tab ended up smaller than usual.
Service has generally been good.
The decor is nice, with a lot of cool art - though strangely (given the place's name) there's only a small picture of a crow on one wall, and a giant picture of an owl on the long wall opposite the bar.
We were seated close to the front door on a cold day, but it didn't feel drafty. I'm not sure how they manage that, but they're doing something right.",,,

In Pasta, I personally love the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni- not the spiciest, but a creamy, tangy, herb-y pasta. Spicy shrimp feels similar as well. Absolutely love the Spicy shrimp appetizer!
WARNING- This place will feel expensive when going in a group of less than 3.
But overall I take off a star because of food & drinks pricing- it is steep in general. My girlfriend & I, ended up spending $80, with taxes, for one pasta and one tiramisu. No drinks!",,,

Ooof a doof. This place is a straight up dumpster fire. The wife and I ordered delivery from here this evening. The ""entree feast"" of Chicken Limone. Dish + delivery + service fee + tip comes out to about 60+ bucks. No big deal, we're feeling some delicious Italian food vibes, right?
Oh earlier in the evening, Chris....there are so many things I want to tell you.
What you get is a big tray of wilted lettuce, a big tray of tough garlic bread slices, and three small pieces of chicken breast that may have passed by sauce on their way out the door. This chicken was dry, mealy, and tasted like the memory of lemon air freshener.
I was honestly surprised by how bad and inadequate this whole thing was. With so many options in the Seattle area, you really have no reason to give this place a chance.

Kirkland, WA","I came in today to troubleshoot a phone and computer. By the time I was done, I was starving! I hadn't been to this location since our kids were teenagers and I didn't realize that they started serving lunch about a year ago. After I was finished with my work I sat in the bar and looked over their lunch menu. I really had a hard time trying to decide but it came down to the lasagna or the meatball sandwich. The bartender told me the lasagna was her favorite of the two so I went with it. It was much better than I expected and was comparable to my homemade lasagna. Even though the lunch portions are ""lunch"" size it was almost more than I could eat. I was glad I didn't go with a salad or garlic bread because I would have definitely over indulged. The only let down was I was so hungry that I forget to take a picture to post here. If you're in their neighborhood stop in for lunch.
I can't say much about their family style dinners since it's been so long. It was always a fun atmosphere with a small group and a great place to feed teenagers. It sounds like that part hadn't changed.",,,

Seattle, WA","Oh Bucca....how I love thy for your large portions and delicious pastas.
Atmosphere: very old school traditional/stereotypical Italian restaurant with the red & white table cloths and Christmas decor all around. Large pasta sauces every where and pictures of people that have eaten there on the walls.
Food:
Huge portions - they only feed 3 (small) or 5 (large) and there's still plenty for leftovers. I come here with my partner and we get the small, and between the two of us, we can get in a total of 6 meals (so once sit down and 2 times eating the leftovers). But that applied mainly to their Sunday Family Dinners which I think is the best deal. You get garlic bread, salad, sausage, meatballs, and a giant bowl of ziti. We've come here many times for this special and it feeds up halfway through the week. Highly recommend!
+ We've come here for their other pastas as well and I have not been disappointed with their flavors. If you come here just for the pastas, I'd recommend coming with a group because if you order just one dish, there's a lack of variety. That's why some people complain about the prices. It really should be family style.
Overall, I highly recommend Bucca for their Sunday Family Dinners and Half Off Meatball Mondays. Otherwise, if you come here with a large group, it's good to order just a few dishes to share to offset the prices.",,,

Great for parties, which you should bring cause all the food is family style servings. I went in a group of 4 and we barely made a dent in the appetizers. Every dish is literally big enough to feed 4 adults. Apps ordered were the Fried Mac & cheese, Spin Art, Calamari, and bruschetta. All super tasty! The Antipasto salad was great too. Entree I ordered was the Short Rib Orecchiette. It was soo filling. The brownie sundae was crazy big and the Tiramisu hit the spot. The service was the best part of the meal. Our server Paul treated us well and made great drink recommendations. I ordered a rum drink (something tiki) so tasty it's dangerous. You would forget rum was in it.

Their menu has individual-portion options, but they also have a lot family-style options that's meant to serve a couple of people. We ended up ordering two salads, three pastas, and two tiramisu cakes for dessert. The salad, pasta and garlic bread servings were huge. We probably finished less than half of the food. I like the garlic bread and the tiramasu. The pasta and the salads were alright. Lots of quantity, but average quality. Two of the pastas looked and tasted kind of the same even though one was supposed to be spicy. Overall, a decent option to feed Italian food to large parties.",,,

Seattle, WA","I was a fan of buca but you need to control your delivery drivers. Please hire safe drivers that won't curse and scream out of their cars while making illegal turns in a buca vehicle. It was absolutely insane.
This is regarding an incident around noon on 5/30/19.
I was in a right turn lane on Howell and Boren turning, when the buca car pulled up next to me (from behind) in the middle no turn lane. Oncoming traffic made it impossible to make the turn for a bit, but seems like she got impatient.
She pulled up and started screaming obscenities, pulled up in the middle of the intersection, illegally blocking, then made an illegal turn while continuing to screech at me.
So angry Seattle driving, just in a buca car and on meth.
Not a great look.
Please sit down and have a conversation with your staff about driving like normal people.
I road rage too--everyone does from time to time. But your drivers endangered people around them, and that driver at noon today should not be driving for you, let alone on the road to begin with.

Seattle, WA","Italian is my favorite cuisine, so I feel like I've been to every Italian restaurant in Seattle. Visiting Fiasco was such a pleasant surprise and I can't wait to return to try more dishes!
The bf and I recently went to celebrate Valentine's Day a week later to avoid the Valentine's Day dining craziness. During his search for possible V-Day restaurants, he had stumbled on Fiasco.
When we arrived, the restaurant was already fairly busy. We had reservations so we were seated immediately. Our server came over to greet us and poured our water. After giving us a few minutes to look over the drink menu, my bf ordered a cocktail. I was too busy figuring out what to eat that I didn't order any drinks for myself until later.
I recently started a plant based diet so that night was considered my cheat meal. But because I'm trying to be more mindful of consuming meat and animal byproducts, I was on a hunt for something somewhat vegetarian.
To share we decided to order the Figs Got The Blues pizza, which is gorgonzola, caramelized onion, rosemary, and walnuts. I'm a fig fan but never had fig on a pizza before. Let me tell you...I was in love! That pizza was so flavorful and delicious with such an amazing harmony of sweet and savory. I highly recommend ordering that for sure!
For his entree, the bf ordered the Seafood Linguine, which comes with mussels, shrimp, squid, and roasted garlic tomato sauce. I'm allergic to all of that seafood, so he thoroughly enjoyed that all on his own. The one super minor minor comment I'd like to make about this dish is that it probably would've completely rocked it even more if it came with some bread. Why? Because my bf enjoyed the leftover roasted garlic tomato sauce that had marinated in all that seafood deliciousness a lot, but he didn't have anything to soak it all up and devour it with other than the ends of our pizza crust! So Fiasco, if you're reading this, maybe hook people up with some bread for this dish so all that delicious sauce can be mopped up!
For my cheat meal, I ordered the Roasted Squash Risotto. That was prepared with apple cider gastrique, which I learned from our server that it's a fancy word for reduction! There was crispy prosciutto, toasted pumpkin seed, goat cheese, and fried sage. Oh my lanta was that a delicious risotto dish! I'm a huge risotto fan and that was by far, one of my favorite risotto dishes I've ever had. It was so flavorful. The combination of the goat cheese, squash, and apple cider gastrique was amazeballs. If you like risotto as much as I do, I highly recommend ordering that.
While we were waiting for our food, I decided to order a glass of wine to celebrate a late Valentine's Day. I asked our server for something a little on the sweeter side. He was very knowledgeable about the wines they had and recommended a 2-glass sampler. I can't remember which wines I tried, but I received 2 half pours of two really tasty wines that I enjoyed very much. So if you tend to be indecisive like me, I recommend asking your server for a sampler!
Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert, so we didn't order anything to satisfy any sugary cravings. Everything we ordered was incredibly delicious. Service was on point. And overall, our experience here was wonderful. Definitely recommend coming here for dinner!",,,

However the dinner plates were terrible. I ordered the seafood linguine and everything just tasted like it was boiled all together and then a completely watered down sauce. The waiter was nice enough to take it off the bill but had said when he grabbed the plate ""it didn't look right when I picked it up from the kitchen, like the sauce wasn't fully reduced.""
That comment really irritates me because if you notice something isn't right why would you serve it? We had definitely waited awhile for the food and the server even came out to say something about the wait and we had told him no problem. I'd always rather wait a little longer and get good food.",,,

Seattle, WA","#TBT to Valentine's Day which swiftly came and went. Now, a popular thing is ""Galentine's Day"" celebrated with your favorite friends the day before. I love how pretty much anything goes these days.
Valentine's Day is not just for couples anymore! In the last few years, my husband and I prefer celebrating heart day with our kids and then having a separate date night another day to make it more our own.
On Valentine's Day, my family and I went to a restaurant in South Wallingford called FIASCO, which is part of The Heavy Restaurant Group.
Fiasco is a casual neighborhood restaurant that focuses mainly on Italian food. The interior is comfortable and attractive. On warm days, they have a nice patio for outdoor eating. The restaurant is also roomy enough to accommodate both small and large groups. They take reservations and are very kid-friendly. Most importantly, the food and service have both been really good so far.
We feasted on an appetizer of Fried Oysters to start which was taken off their special Valentines Menu. My hubby devoured his tasty Pappardelle Bolognese with a beer. My Lamb Osso Buco was filling, tender, and went well with my glass of Pinot Noir. Our kid's delighted in their Gnocchi Alla Pomodoro and Kid's Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup.
For dessert, the adults got some Capuccino's, and the four of us shared a plate of creamy Tiramisu and a heavenly plate of Zeppoli (fried sugar donuts with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces).
I love Valentine's Day! Not only is it a great excuse to dine out and splurge a little with people you truly love and care about, but it reminds you to try to work harder to show your loved ones how important they are to you every single day. The cool part is that love is like a boomerang. What you give, in theory, should come right back to you. If it doesn't, then friggin' run the hell the other way and find someone who will love and respect you the way you deserve.",,,

Not too heavily spiced and not too overly strong alcohol. Be careful though because too many and who knows what will happen! LOL! Friends arrived and I of course ordered another Fizz....yum. Our meals were equally as delicious I had the Bolognese which was so flavorful and delicately beautiful. My friend had the Italian chopped salad and the squash bisque which was equally simple but packed with flavor. To end our meal we ordered the zeppoli (mini doughnuts) that came with three sauces. I will definitely be back to try the pizza I saw and get more of the zeppoli and Fizz drink.

Seattle, WA","I must say, this is one of the better Italian restaurants in the Seattle area that's open for lunch.
Came here on a Friday about 15 minutes after they opened. Walked in and was greeted immediately by a friendly server. We were in a hurry so told the server we would like to do take out. She handed us a lunch menu which was simple but had a decent selection of dishes.
We decided on a combo: chop salad with a 6in personal size classic pepperoni pizza. The other dish we selected was the Bucatini with meatball & red sauce.
After we placed our orders, we perused their large wall of wines that were on display. This restaurant has the largest wine selection I've ever seen. After a few minutes, we took a seat on these oversized leather seats. They were actually quite comfortable.
Then our orders came out relatively quickly. Immediately, I got a whiff of that cheesy pepperoni pizza. Almost instantly, my stomach began to speak to me saying, feed me! So, I did.
The pizza's crust was thin and cooked perfectly where it wasn't too crispy nor burnt. It had just the right amount of red sauce. Also, loved the small pepperoni where they curled up into tiny little cups. The best part was the cheese. It was cheesy enough where I had to stretch my arm out while the cheese refused to separate itself from the bite I took.
Next the chop salad! This salad was loaded with chunky salami, cubed provolone cheese, kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, sliced pepperoncini, and fresh crispy lettuce. It was served with a refreshing slightly sweet and a little tart dressing. Absolutely delicious!
Finally, the Bucatini meatballs with red sauce. Initial thought after first bite: wow, this dish is flavorful! The red sauce didnt look like much but it was tasty, it even had a tiny spicy kick to it. That surprised me but in a very pleasant way. The noodles were cooked just the way I like it: al dente. Also, the meatballs were just as delightful. They were well seasoned and had a bounce to each bite.
I am definitely coming back to this restaurant to try other dishes. Also, would recommend this place to all the pasta and pizza lovers out there! Bon appetito!",,,

There's a large ""wine wall"" in the front of the restaurant where they display tons of different bottles of wine. If you don't want one of the standard bottles of wine offered on the menu, you're able to walk over to the giant wine rack and choose a bottle you wish to drink that night! I thought it was a unique, interactive concept.",,,

We sat outside on a nice Seattle evening, enjoying the street chatter. When we ordered our drinks, I couldn't decide and was toying with several of the champagne cocktails, but settled on Prosecco. Our waiter offered to bring me one of the cocktails, the Rinomato, and if I didn't like it he would gladly swap it out. I loved that option, and ended up enjoying his drink recommendation.
We were surprised to find that our waiter brought us a complimentary appetizer, a Prosciutto Bruschetta - PHENOMENAL! Hubs said it was one of his top 5 appetizers ever!! It was topped with mascarpone, prosciutto, basil and honey. It was a wonderful flavor combo!
For my entr茅e, I selected the Chicken Piccata. It was buttery goodness, lemon was not overpowering and the entr茅e was very filling. Hubs got a pizza, I didn't hear any complaints.
Even though I was stuffed and very sastified, we ordered donuts for the table. They came with (espresso?) chocolate and caramel sauce and we LOVED them.
I'll gladly be back! Great atmosphere, delicious eats and EXCELLENT service!",,,

The salads are the best thing in the menu, and the two we had were the Chinky Avocado and the Peach Panzanelle (I may have spelled that wrong).
The avocado salad was filled with chunks of creamy avocado and had a toasted quinoa, which was really delightful. The dressing was yummy and one of the best salads I've had.
The peach salad was tangy and I loved it as well. Not real sure where the peach cane in, but still great all the same.
We also had several of the pastas and the grilled chicken piccata. The pasta and zucchini that came with the chicken piccata were the best part...something addictive with the zucchini seasoning, and although it was really good, the chicken breast was pretty standard.
While I really enjoyed dinner here, I'd like to come back instead for happy hour because a lot of great things on that menu including the avocado salad, and the salads are the real winners here!",,,

I ordered a meatball sandwich no bun which came with a nice arugula salad. Came with six meatballs which I was surprised by! My husband got spicy shrimp polenta. The total was $73 with no drinks. The spicy shrimp polenta came with 5 small pieces of shrimp which is absurd for a $25 dish that is mostly cornmeal. The spicy sauce was really good though.
We came here when it used to be Thackeray and liked it too but did feel it was overpriced. This place (still same restaurant group) is even more overpriced it seems.",,,

So, a few coworkers and I took some clients out to lunch and selected Fiasco as our location. In from South Korea, we wanted them to have a great experience. Unfortunately, it seems this location is still the same as it ever was.
As soon as we arrived, we were told the kitchen was backed up despite the restaurant only being half full. The biggest offense though was the giant hair one of the clients found in their salad.
Once we notified the waiter, he didn't even apologize. He simply took it back to the kitchen and we had to wait another 15 minutes for a replacement to come out. And when it did finally come out, it was once again without any sort of apology. They still charged us for his meal too.",,,

The pie + glass of wine for $13 is a steal.
We also got the bread and garlic w/ oil, which was delicious - fabulous bread! The fried artichokes were also delicious, not a super common menu item so was nice to try.
The pizza is delicious, the happy hour size is small but with other apps it is fine. Crispy, thin crust! The wine was alright, but not great.
Excellent service - the waitress dropped one of our pizzas and brought a complimentary salad while they made a new one, which was out moments later.

Green Lake, Seattle, WA","Wow, what a difference between our last time and this weekend, 7 months later. DISASTER! Went there with seven other members of my family to celebrate 6 birthdays of our 8 person party, and the kitchen couldn't get our food out to us in less than 75, yes 7-5, minutes. No, it wasn't busy, in fact half empty at 615p on Saturday night - not a great sign anyway. During this eternity, we were told the entrees would be right out two separate times, while no manager came to ask what he could do, offer drinks or even complimentary bread. My 86 year old mother commented that it was even worse service than at her rest home. When they finally got some entrees out to us, 3 of the 8 took additional time. The pasta was warm, but not hot, but we were exhausted by that time and just dealt with it.
Server, Phil, was apologetic but the damage had been done. I picked the restaurant, and was embarrassed by the ""fiasco"". In the end, they comp'd 30% off the bill, but with so many choices in Seattle, it would take an extraordinary circumstance for is to return. Maybe the company that owns Fiasco and Pablo y Pablo is the issue, since you either have a culture of serving your customer, or you don't!

I enjoy a nice ambiance but it was incredibly loud and so dark that the entire restaurant had their phones out in order to read the menu (average age seemed to be mid 30s).

Same outdoor seating and the interior is bright and colorful with a beautiful bar.
I was a party of 3 whom sat outside. Service was good for the most part; our waitress was lovely but did get slammed multiple times inside so there were moments we were left patiently waiting...
We took advantage of HH for the most part. My phone died before I could photograph all items but here's a breakdown.
-Olives were good, nice citrusy flavor. I've had better but I've had less awe inspiring olives so I would suggest giving them a try.
-Broccolini has a nice flavor, maybe slightly vinegary, but the roasted garlic was a nice touch. There were only 4 pretty thin pieces though so the portion size to price was kind of a bummer.
-Olive bruschetta with goat cheese was yummy. Awesome charred bread and lovely flavor from the toppings. Again, the portion for the price was a little disappointing. Not much of a bite when shared with 3 people.
-Chunky avocado salad, must try!! We loved the vinaigrette mixed with the fris茅e and generous amount of avocado with pepitas (slightly too salty) and crispy quinoa. Mmmm
-My friend said the Gnocchi was really good; nice texture and a delicious red sauce. Very flavorful.
-Goaty goat goat pizza was great! I love their crust, thing and crispy with a bit of chew. The flavor was fantastic. Highly recommend if you enjoy goat cheese.
Overall, we had a great experience at fiasco. Docked a star only for the moments of lackluster service and (too) small appetizer portions.",,,

Husband and I shared the arugula salad with fresh shaved parmesan, toasted hazlenuts and, sweet balsamic - a perfectly fresh, balanced salad. Food came out fast.
I LOVED the pizza al funghi - very flavorful sausage and deep, layered mushroom + cheese topped a slightly sourdough, thin, chewy srust with perfectly crisped edges. Another reviewer had said: having lived in Italy, this is the BEST pizza outside of Italy and I have to agree with one exception: Keste in NYC. So, best west coast pizza outside of Italy. Seriously excellent the next day too, so don't worry if you can't finish the whole thing.
My husband ordered the pork ragu, which must have been slow simmered. It was served over potatoes, with plenty of reduced onions. Rich and satisfying; seasoning spot on.
As an extra, we tried the arancini: superb! Three hot, crispy combo-bites of pomodoro-flavored rice with mildy melty cheese in the center. We ended up taking one of these home too - Mmmm best at-home lunch treat ever on Saturday. Our only regret: no time to linger and try desserts. When we go to Bar del Corso next time, I'll try the olive oil lemon cake.
HIGHLY recommend Bar del Corso. They sure know their way around a pizza oven and a ragu. Very welcoming, convivial place.",,,

We put our name on the list and snuck over to Bar Queztal for a drink while we waited. You can also enjoy a drink in Bar del Corso while you wait -- if you can get to the bar. We had no such luck as the bar was packed.
We were disappointed that they were out of a few things by the time we were seated but enjoyed every single thing we had. After living in Italy, this was one of the best pizzas I've had - and close to home, so lucky! The arancini reminded me of Rome (more specifically, drunken nights in Rome). We almost licked the plate clean. The pizza was fantastic - chewy, slightly charred, great flavors. We enjoyed some creative drinks - my husband had one with an orange foam. It was a grown-up orange cream float and it was DIVINE. We argued over it :) Finally, for desert a rich, fresh huckleberry panna cotta. The desert was to die for - you could taste the quality of the cream.

Kitsilano, Vancouver, Canada","Bar Del Corso is a hidden gem of Beacon Hill! I can't believe I've driven past this place a bajillion times over 10 year and yet I have not once tried it until now. I came in on a Friday around 6:30pm for a casual date night - we only waited about 5 minutes till we got seated. I was encouraged to find a decent amount of people waiting inside the restaurant! Their interior feels homey and it's bustling with energy. I did find the noise level louder than a normal restaurant, but I liked how energetic the atmosphere felt.
What to order:
-FUNGHI PIZZA: if you're a shroom lover like me, then you'll love this pizza! Mushrooms and sausage! It also comes with pizza scissors so you can cut the slice to the size of your desire. Its wood-fired pizza too. The only little let down was that some bits of the bottom of the pizza was a little burnt. But the flavor on top was still great so I still ate it!
-FRIED RISOTTO BALLS: its got a great crisp, yet piping hot interior with melty mozzarella cheese in the middle. A great small plate to go with your meal!
-ARUGULA PEAR BALSAMIC SALAD: the balance of flavors and textures in this salad was refreshing and delicious. Pears were sweet and the cheese and arugula paired so well with it.
-GRILLED OCTOPUS: so tender and it felt like a mix between italian and spanish flavors. The sauce is delicious so I would be sure to order a side of housemade bread to soak it all up!
We practically finished ALL this food except for half the pizza and the bill was under $55. What a bargain! Service was quick and the server who helped us was attentive and helpful in helping us make our choices.

Issaquah, WA","Love this place. Fun and friendly atmosphere with good service, food, and drinks to boot. Came on the recommendation of a friend, and have been back twice more for drinks and pizza.
My first experience at Bar Del Corso was April 2018- three of us stopping in for dinner around 7 PM on a weekday evening. The wait was about 10 minutes, and even more painless considering you can order a drink while you wait. I have yet to experience a wait more than 5-10 minutes, but 7/8 is generally also the earliest you'll catch me out for dinner.
Parking is easy on Beacon Ave or in any of the neighborhoods perpendicular. Inside the atmosphere is very much a casual neighborhood bar/cafe vibe, with an open kitchen concept, an open area of seating between wooden beams, as well as seating at the bar. I think this serves well for any occasion whether you're having a quick/casual drink, dinner, or a decent night out in the neighborhood.
The menu is seasonal and simple with a good selection of small plates, salads, cheese/meat, and excellent Neapolitan pizzas! Can't go wrong with their salads/veggies, the Burrata is a fantastic choice, as well as the grilled octopus.
The Pizza... yes. I'd venture to say the pizza here falls confidently in my top 2/3 favorites in Seattle. Perfectly thin and wood-fire charred, the right amount of sauce and cheese, with delicious toppings. The Funghi is a great choice. They also provide you with fun pizza cutting scissors to create your own sized slices.
As for the bar- they generally have a small but good selection of beers on tap, and great cocktails at a fair price. I've been more than happy with the Aperol Spritz and Negroni here.
All things considered, Bar Del Corso hits high on every cylinder. It is convenient to get to and park, wait times aren't crazy, boasts a fun and friendly atmosphere for any occasion, and then there's the pizza.. (insert heart-eyes emoji.) This is one of those reviews that it pains me to write because I don't want it to get more busy and popular but regardless I hope you'll give it a try. Cheers!",,,

My girlfriend friend and I are pretty and snobby about our Italian food (being from the NY area). This place does not need to be graded on a curve.
We shared the arugula salad, suppli, burata, and clams. Maybe one dish too many but would not have been able to skip any of them in retrospect. And to make my gluttony worse, I could not get the ""polenta cake with gold pear"" from the dessert board off of my mind...so I indulged. I rarely order dessert but am so happy I did...tears of joy well up remembering it.

Seattle, WA","It gives me no pleasure to say this but Seattle may be one of if not the worst pizza cities in America. The dollar slice spots I've been to don't even know how to operate a business let alone make a decent pizza (seriously if your business closes at 2:30 don't run out of pizza at 1:45 and stop making pizza it's not that complicated). I didn't have high expectations going into Bar Del Corso and my expectations sank when I got there and there was a long wait. On the one hand maybe it's because the pizza was good on the other hand maybe it's because there are like 3 restaurants in Beacon Hill and this was one lol. Anyways when we finally got seated and got our food this place definitely blew me away. The risotto and cheese balls were a great appetizer (they only give 3 in a tray so if you're really hungry order 2 of them) and the pizza itself was exceptional. It's by my count the only Seattle pizza place that exceeds the extremely low bar of being better than a Dominoes (no seriously dominoes might be #2). We ordered the margherita pizza - added tip get the prosciutto on there and cook it, it has a nice crisp to it. There was also a sausage and peppers pizza we got that was also excellent. And as an added bonus the owner is really friendly and does talk to customers. Apparently Megan Rapinoe used to frequent this place and she's real chummy with her, which is kind of a fun fact you can tell your friends about if that's the sort of thing you're into (hey this pizza place I went to Megan rapinoe also went to a lot!). My only negative is the wait is kind of long, but well worth it given that this is the only pizza worth going out of your way to eat in a 300 mile radius (probably).

The atmosphere is casual and feels like a bustling neighborhood hang out. They have some outdoor seating in the front and the back, perfect for Seattle summers.
We ordered the Salami pizza, Vongole alla marinara, and the Arugula and frisee salad.
Everything was delicious! The pizza was incredibly thin, perfect char, and amazing ingredients. The clams were made with fresh tomatoes and came with the perfect assortment of breads to soak up the yummy sauce in. We were impressed by the salad because we make a very similar one at home... but somehow theirs was ten times better! It was perfectly dressed and balanced and the ingredients were super fresh.

They always have quite the crowd and line out the door, but we always manage to get a table in 45 minutes or less. Their menu is very straightforward and the options are good, since I don't like having a million and one options. Service is always on point, and I really enjoy the overall ambiance of the place. One minor thing, was that some of the pizzas tasted burnt to me on our last visit, but I guess that's what you get with a wood fired oven.
With your pizzas, they give you scissors to cut your pizza, and cute containers of chili oil and chili flakes on the side.
I've tried multiple pizzas and other dishes here including:
Burrata and Rapini: yum! great appetizer option that had me feeling light, but still filled us up
Corno Di Capra: one of my favorite pizzas!! delicious!

Unfortunately, they don't take reservations but you could tell the waitress that you don't mind sitting at the bar, which was what we did and it ended up being around a 40 min wait for us.
The menu consists of small plates to share, salads, some sliced meats, cheeses, and of course, the pizzas! There is not a huge selection of pizzas to choose from, but everything sounded amazing. We were starving and ended up ordering two to share - the funghi and the margherita. Both were so so good! The pizzas were thin, had the perfect char to them, and were not overloaded with ingredients to make them fancy. The simplicity is what really helped highlight the products they use. They also bring you a pair of scissors so you can cut the pizza yourself.

Bar Del Corso is just a little bit out side of downtown Seattle, on the main street of Beacon Hill, so there is free street parking available. The restaurant itself is nice and open with an interesting art on the walls. There is both bar and table seating, but can get packed in busy times.
The staff is great, they are vary laid back while still attentive. This is a very causal place to eat some great food with friends and it can get pretty loud in here.
The pizza style is Neapolitan, so it thin crust with a nice char on the bottom. There only 6 pizza options on the menu, with maybe a one or two more on the special of the night. All of the options are only a few ingredients so the pizza are fairly simple, but done really well and highlight those ingredients.

My friend and I met up for dinner on a weekend and we ordered 4 dish: rapini (with poached egg), arugula and beets salad, grilled octopus and beans, and a Funghi (mushroom and sausage) pizza. We both enjoyed the meal and the ambiance of the restaurant...it was a non pretentious classuc meal yet very casuso enough that you feel so comfortable hanging out there.
Our meal portion was good! Our of all the dish, I enjoyed the Rapini (fresh filling and still light and refreshing to eat with accompanied bread!) and the grilled octopus (great to have octopus once in a while for me...and I loved that they gave us plenty of bread to sop the sauce!) The most. The pizza was good too..it wasn't too oily and I loved the smell and the mix of mushroom and meat on it. The salad was ok..quite ordinary..but nothing wrong with it. I think I will skip next time to try something else. We ate a lot but yet still had some salad and pizza leftovers for the next day.
Overall, a great, busy very reasonably priced restaurant in Beacon Hill to check out!
P.S: go early when they open at 5pm! We showed up at 4:4 5pm and the line was already forming. By the time we left, there were so many people waiting for the tables! They don't take reservations...and if you don't show up around opening time, you will likely have to wait in a potentially long line for your seat!",,,

We ordered the meatballs along with a margherita pizza and despite appearing delicious they were both MEH -- nothing special, almost bland! Very disappointing because I've never encountered such bland Italian food. I'll say though that the pizza crust was nice and thin and crisp, but the taste of charred crust was really all I tasted, and not because it was overpowering but because the sauce tasted like only a whisper of marinara.

I came with a friend on a Friday night around 6 and it was packed. Despite all the people waiting for a table, the wait only about 15 minutes.
The menu is quite small, but packed with goodness. We got the Suppli a Telefono (risotto balls), Polpettine (meatballs), and Funghi pizza. Risotto balls were the bomb. Rice and cheese rolled into a ball and fried golden brown. These are the kind of balls you want in your mouth... Meatballs were also very good served in a rich marinara sauce with slices of bread. Finally, the pizza is awesome. The crust is impossibly thin, yet still has structure, bite and the right amount of char. This is some of the best pizza in Seattle. The pizza comes uncut, with a pair of scissors so you can cut your own slices. You can cut once and say you only had 2 slices. The total came to a little over $30 for 2 which is an absolute steal. They don't have Happy Hour, but with these prices it's basically always Happy Hour.
The restaurant has the feel of an old local Italian joint with long bar area, open kitchen and large pizza oven roaring in the back. The staff was excellent and I can't say enough about the waitress that was running the double duty as the hostess. She really kept everything in check. If you can't tell, I'm in love with this place. I'm already plotting my next trip back.",,,

firstly, i AM NOT a huge red pasta fan but this dish was so promising that i might be turning to the red side. i cannot believe it was this good because sometimes take out can taste different from when you dine in so i can't imagine how good this was dining in!
i got the lamb & beef bolognese rigatoni pasta that was topped with some fine n dandy mozzarella. (y'all)
this was by far the best red sauce pasta i've had. so many intentional flavors that gave my taste buds a dance party. like seriously this was great quality pasta & it wasn't dry! it was good, saucy & had a kick to it. i appreciate this pasta so much & i will be coming back here for more. next visit i will be sure to dine in :)
small portions, but good bc the flavors are SO POWERFUL!",,,

Seattle, WA","After having this place bookmarked for a couple years, I decided to come here for my birthday dinner. I came with super high expectations given all the positive reviews on yelp (with most negative ones being around slow service - which didn't concern me since I was not planning on rushing).
Sadly I was disappointed. Contrary to the other negative feedback I read, the best thing about my dinner was the service. The staff seemed really nice and they were attentive. And the food came out pretty quickly. Other than that.... the theme of the night had to do with things being seasoned poorly. We started with bread ($3/person). The bread itself was great (Seawolf bread) but there were huge salt granules on the aioili/garlic, which you can see even in my poorly lighted picture. We needed to scrap off the entire top layer to get to the 'good stuff'. The Brussels sprouts were so salty we couldn't even finish it. The burrata was the same case. I ended up scrapping off what salt I could from the cheese and all the crackers for it to be edible. The hamachi was ok. We couldn't really tell if the fish was ultra fresh (seemed ok) with all the mixings on it. But the granita on it made was like biting into a chunk of ice with each bite. We heard the group next to us remark the exact same thing.
Here comes the plot twist... the lamb had absolutely no salt! (Haha, right?) We ended up transferring some of our salt scrapings from the overly salty dishes and added it to the lamb. Last but not least, the dish I was personally looking forward to... the truffle pasta. This was tasty and we finished the dish, but I can definitely think of better pasta dishes for much cheaper if you know what I mean.
All in all, I am sad to report that I would not personally go back here. I truly hope this was a one off since so many others have said positive things but given $ per dish, I would recommend other spots that have consistently delivered for me.",,,

Seattle, WA","This well known restaurant in Queen Anne is owned by one of members of Seattle's restauranteur cartel, who own and operate an amalgam of successful, popular restaurants in Seattle. The cartel members with names such as Erickson, Douglas, Dillon, and in this case Stowell, open and close restaurants seemingly at will. All have a following, and all
seem to make money. Some I like, some are just okay. How to Cook A Wolf, even with its obnoxious name, tries hard to please.
The staff is pleasant, catering to the young clientele, playing hip hop and rap loudly on the sound system. The place is tiny, and thus the music was the star on this chilly Sunday night. As always, we sat at the bar and our server, although a bit saccharin and ""over the top,"" was
professional and friendly. The crispy duck leg was fantastic, but the portion very small. My requested classic cace e pepe pasta was overwhelmed by the peppercorns. While the pasta was cooked al dente, the over powering pepper almost made the dish in eatable. My wife began coughing after one taste and waved it off. I ate the pasta because I wanted her to enjoy the duck leg.
Surprisingly, I enjoyed How To Cook A Wolf more than my wife, who was appalled at the pasta; she being Italian. Hey, the kitchen hit 500, that's okay, and makes me want to try it again.",,,

Seattle, WA","I had been to other Ethan Stowell restaurants, but this was this first time I drove up Queen Anne hill to eat here. I thought the meal was excellent and I will need to return soon.
His restaurants always have excellent wine lists. Here I ordered the Savage Grace cab franc and it was excellent. The menu consists of small plates and large plates--although some of the small plates are not so small.
I started with Brussels Sprouts and the Burrata. The Brussels sprouts came with a vinaigrette and bread crumbs and were cooked wonderfully. Then I really loved the burrata, it tasted so good on the fennel crackers that came with it.
I had two pastas for large plates, the rigatoni and the tagliarini. Both were good, but I preferred the rigatoni. The lamb and beef bolognese sauce that came with it was incredible then the fresh pasta is so delicious. The pasta with the tagliarini was also great and that dish came with some great mushrooms.
Although I was pretty full, I had the cannoli for dessert. It is a generous one that I could not finish. The shells were flaky and just perfect, but the pistachio cream was out of this world. This was a great dining experience overall.",,,

Seattle, WA","Fantastic tapas bar with awesome service! Came here to welcome my sister moving to Seattle and can't wait to come back.
We started off with the tomatoes, burrata, and shishito peppers and all were good but the burrata was my favorite. It came with salted crisps and some lightly mashed tomato which blended well with the burrata, cutting the richness and adding a complex variety of flavor. The tomatoes were super fresh served on top of reduced balsamic with some basil spread on top and were very tasty. Shishito peppers are always amazing and they found a nice way to distinguish with the crisped bread crumbs and artichoke and while good weren't the best served.
For entrees we split the short rib pasta and the salmon. The salmon was spectacular with crisped edges and served on a great sauce with veggies. The pasta was also super fresh and the short rib added a lot of flavor.

How To Cook a Wolf,(206) 838-8090,"Stacy P.
Seattle, WA","I've had this on my list for over a year now, and now that I live here, I had to make it a point to get in. I understand the process better now, as the restaurant is fairly small, so there aren't too many reservations to be had. We got in on a Monday night, 7:45 reservation. 3 of us.
Sat at the corner table by the window. Note: wear your jacket. There's a reason why there is a rolled up carpet cutting off the draft from the floorboards. I was basically cuddling up with my friend on her leg. lol
The server was pleasant, but distracted. They were understaffed. Our waters came out, we ordered some plates to share, but I was in starvation mode, so I chose the sourdough for 3 to start. At $3 per piece of bread with an accompaniment of garlic and fennel honey butter.... should be good, right? Except two other dishes came out first, with you guessed it, toast pieces or crackers. By the time the bread got there, we had filled up on other carbs. I should've declined the late sourdough arrival.
Dish 1 - Burrata - English Peas, Mint, Fennel Cracker
This was very tasty and the burrata creamy, love the addition of the peas, they were bright and a fresh spring feel to the dish. A bit too much on the olive oil.
Dish 2 - Lamb Tartare - Anchovy Vinaigrette, Fresh Herbs, Garlic Toast
There were some lamb chunks that were sinewy and overall, way heavy handed on the oil. It was like Olive Oil took over. Two bites and I was done. Delightful presentation, but that's where that ended.
Dish 3 - The Sourdough Bread. I think I was already breaded out at that point. The honey butter with the one bite of bread I had was lovely.
Dish 4 - Polenta Fritters - Ricotta, Sage, Chestnut Honey
My favorite dish. Lightly crisp on the outside, and fluffy inside, nice and hot. Sat on top of a sweetly ricotta base and hints of sage. Well done. Bravo!
Dish 5 - Tagliatelle - Wild Ramp, English Pea, Egg Yolk, Prosciutto Brodo
Tasty. Noodles stuck together though. Boring dish overall. Nothing stood out. Next.
Dish 6 - Strozapretti - Pork Belly, Tomato, Calabrian Chili, Pecorino
Tastiest dish of all the dishes. Pork belly was a shade stiff. Still some residual olive oil taste though. Server said the dish would be spicy, it wasn't spicy in the least bit. Definitely the more tasty of the two pastas.
My opinion, overpriced for the quality of food. Bread should always come out first. My palate was so ""olive oil'd"" I'm surprised I didn't get Popeye'd as I left!",,,

Seattle, WA","This is an amazing restaurant and I loved everything about it. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and it definitely lived up to my expectations. Upon arrival we were greeted with glasses of champagne to celebrate my birthday. We followed that up with some delicious cocktails, I ordered the Patio Season and my gf ordered their house sangria.
As good as the drinks and the cozy dining space were the food was still the star. We got six total items counting dessert. Sea Wolf Sourdough with roasted garlic and fennel honey butter was an amazing start. That came out at the same time as the Hamachi Crudo, which while tasty and wonderful to eat on warmer days would probably be the thing I'd cut first for next time as I'd rather try another pasta or maybe a seasonal small plate. To follow those we had the Smoked Salmon Bruschetta with pickled shallots. Then came the mains. The Cassareccia pasta was absolutely sensational. The short rib was so tender and flavorful while the carrot sofrito gave it some spice. The cheese on top gave it a nice balance. The pasta was a perfect al dente and this was the highlight of the meal for me. A very close second place would go to the Beelers Pork Belly that followed. The pork was fatty yet crispy. The peaches and shishitos that accompanied it were a nice touch and the romesco sauce was heavenly and brought the whole dish together. Both of these mains are must orders as long as they are on the menu and you have an appetite for meat.
After all of this we were feeling full but wanted a sweet treat to end the evening so we split the lemon tart with blueberry frozen yogurt as it seemed like a good choice with the sun setting on us as we closed out our evening. They even served it with a candle on top for me! The service was wonderful throughout the night and we will definitely return.

We were seated at the bar after calling with a 10 min notice and was accommodated. The host was very polite and sat us at our seats while introducing us to the bartender who was friendly and kind. The bartender walked us through the different drinking options. It was great that he offered to even surprise us if we were in the mood to try something new. We told him that we were open to trying something new and he asked what kind of alcohol base we enjoy and if we preferred more alcohol or fruity tastes. It was entertaining to watch him create the drinks and put them together. He explained the drinks to us and they tasted amazing!
We then ordered the broccoli, polenta fritters (my favorite!), the bread, the mushroom gnocchi and chocolate budino. The menu had recently changed so the pasta and dessert were great surprises!

It's probably the best service I've ever received in a restaurant ever. Period. Hands down. Our server could've recited the entire menu from memory, never needed to write our orders down, was able to suggest pairings of drinks, appetizers, and desserts, and had everything timed perfectly, so we could enjoy the pace of the meal. What an experience.
The inside space is small (definitely make a reservation if you can), but it has elegant, yet homey vibes, with cozy lighting and decoration to keep the atmosphere perfect for a date night, but appropriate for a business dinner. The drink menu is exquisite, with some of the most unique cocktail combinations ever. All that I tried were delicious.
The portions are small - the menu is clearly meant to sample and share, but if you're bold and looking to try what's available, this place is an absolute must.

Started out with drinks from a collection of original cocktails. I had to try the Professor Burgess as that's my family's surname and it was perfect.
The food was spectacular. Polenta fritters over ricotta, a beet salad with crumbles of cheese and my personal favorite, bruschetta with mushrooms. The pork belly over grits was perfectly cooked and moist. I recommend the ravioli as well.

Sourdough bread - 5/5
Comes with honey butter and roasted garlic in balsamic and olive oil. Absolutely delightful and must get for $2/person.
Beef carpaccio - 5/5
Great balance in this dish between the beef, greens, and mushrooms. Every bite was full of flavor and interesting texture.
Spaghetti Bolognese - 5/5
We had a late dinner so they actually ran out of the tagliatelle and kindly asked me if they could sub in spaghetti instead. The Bolognese sauce had such a great kick to it and the spaghetti was perfectly al dente. I'd come back to just eat this.
Sage Ravioli with pancetta - 4/5
Very flavorful! Actually it wasn't what we expected on first bite, but quickly grew to love it. Ended up using some of the sourdough to soak up all of the sauce to not let the leftover go to waste!

I've tried the fresh egg pastas, a few raviolis, and tonight picked up some kale pesto!
The kale pesto was delicious, creamy and had a nice kick to it.
The pasta is fresh, and keeps very well in the freezer if you ever find that you want to stock up for a few months during off season for farmers markets. It cooks up very nicely, and even when reheated the texture stays nice and chewy

On the box, it claimed the cooking time to be 6 minutes. However, the edges of our ravioli was still pretty hard. I think I cooked it for like 12 minutes, just like how I usually cook my dumpling (you know, add cold water once it boils, repeat 3 times). I used a regular tomato sauce with some stir-fried onion slices to accompany it. I'm out of cheese powders, so I just added some Italian seasoning and seaweed (I KNOW I KNOW! JUST FOR THE LOOK OK? haha!). It came out yummy even though I'm not a fan of ravioli.
Price:
My husband got 35 pieces of smoked salmon ravioli for ~$12, which is a bit pricy for me since I'm cheap. But it's an okay price as ravioli are usually really expensive in restaurants.
Overall:
Consider it's easy to cook, I'd give it a 4 stars. However, the cooking time it definitely more than 6 minutes unlike you like HARD ravioli edges!

The worse Italian food you can even think about. We tried to have the soup Nona vita, Polpo Affogato and the Spaguetti Allla Bolognese. Poor quality of ingredients, the zucchini and the carrots are huge size, bad cut.
If you are craving a decent Italian food, stay away of this place.",,,

Seattle, WA","Worst Italian food I have ever had in Seattle. We ordered through a delivery app -- maybe they cut corners on those orders? The octopus was almost plastic in texture and flavor, the bolognese was flavorless, and the Nonna Vita inedible.
From the other reviews here it must be a different story in person, but they need to either up their game for delivery, or get off the apps.",,,

Seattle, WA","I'm super happy to have found a very authentic Italian restaurant right next door! My girlfriend and I walked here the other day, and we were both surprised about how delicious the food was!!! We had one of the linguine dishes with meatballs, which were just perfectly seasoned and cooked just right, moist and delicious. We also had the ravioli, also very well done and the seasoning and sauce were well balanced to allow the homemade pasta to shine, but still give the right texture and complete the flavor of the dish!
The only Con to this place is the 25$ Corking fee!!!!! OOFF! That one hurts, so in the future we will not be drinking when we come here, but the food has allowed me to keep this place at a 5 star review despite the ridiculous corkage fee.
Keep up the good work guys!",,,

Seattle, WA","Came here with a Groupon still on the hunt for a go to or even return to Italian restaurant in Seattle. The staff was super friendly and observant. Food arrived promptly. No problems with front of house service.
My order: Insalata Cesare, Fettuccine con Salsiccia, and a glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo for my meal and then tiramisu and a cappuccino for dessert.
The highlights of the evening for me were the wine, tiramisu and cappuccino. The tiramisu was lighter than I expected (perhaps more whipped cream or whipped egg whites to zabaglione and marscapone than normal) but the flavors were SPOT on. Seems from the other yelp reviews that the dessert are on point, so props to whoever is making those.
The salad was ok; not bad but also not super memorable.
The pasta was the real challenge for me. I enjoyed the sausage and the general flavor profile; however, the pasta was extremely stodgy. Some pieces of pasta were cooked differently than others and not all of it was even fettuccine (I think some linguine snuck in there). Overall the cook was way off to the point that I just ate the meat and a few bites and openly welcomed the arrival of dessert.
All in all, if I was in the neighborhood, I might stop by for some wine, tiramisu, and coffee and there is a slight chance I might try a different type of pasta, but this is not a place I would take my family to or go out of my way to return to.",,,

Seattle, WA","Gnocchi Gorgonzola with ""special"" dehydrated ""chicken"" flown in all the way from the Arabian dessert. This chicken is so parched, you'll feel like you're lost in the Sahara with each bite. This virtual experience can be yours too for only $25 pr plate.
I was excited to try something new and the reviews here looked great--So, I figured I'd give this place a try. I've been craving gnocchi gorgonzola with chicken ever since I ordered it from Brunello Ristorante Italiano a few months ago and was complete wrecked by its deliciousness. But, my meal at Mondello was unfortunately disappointing. The gnocchi itself was not bad. However the gorgonzola sauce lacked flavor and the chicken was offensive. There's no way that someone who cares about what they do and the people they serve, would served anyone the chicken that came on my gnocchi. It was literally hard as a rock. It looked like a chicken topping from a dominos pizza delivery would look like after sitting in your fridge for three weeks. I don't understand why some restaurants send out shitty food via delivery. This is not entirely uncommon, though I cannot say it's a regular pattern at Mondello, as I haven't ordered from them but this one time. So many people order delivery these days, you would think restaurants would recognize that kill'n the delivery game would bring in loads of new customers. Unfortunately, the message Mondello sent me with my delivery, was that they don't care about their delivery customers or the quality of food they provide to them. I am not sure their food is better in house, but, I for sure wont be fooled into spending nearly $30 on a single entree of this quality from Mondello ever again.",,,

The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is a hidden gem in the neighborhood. If you're in Magnolia for dinner - this is the place to be. I always order the Ravioli Marsala, it just melts in your mouth with each bite. I've also had the gnocchi and it's AMAZING! You just can't go wrong!",,,

Seattle, WA","My husband and I have been loyal customers of Mondello for years because it was the homey spot for good Italian food in our neighborhood. We were able to look past their fairly regular service blunders and mishaps, and the fact that the red wine was always served at 85+ degrees because we still felt welcomed and the food was plentiful and the quality was high.
But, after eating at Mondello a week ago, they have lost us. The family has faced the very sad loss of their matriarch, and the eyes on this restaurant now have a very different arrogance and focus on cutbacks for their own benefit. The place now feels like another manipulative Seattle restaurant taking sneaky steps to give you less for the same cost which will backfire as the experience and food quality has massively suffered.
We were made to wait for 10 minutes for a table even though we had a reservation. A pack 'em mentality. Newly implemented, bread is rationed at one piece per customer and refilled for a charge. Red wine is still served too hot, yet the price per glass probably exceeds the value of the whole bottle. Portion sizes have shrunk, now 5 ravioli where there used to be 6 and they taste nothing like they used to. Veal has been replaced with bread in the no-meatballs. I mean, come on! Isn't that like the oldest trick in the book?

They listed their lasagna as their signature dish. I had a business meeting coming up in the Magnolia area so I made it a point to my coworker to make a stop here for lunch.
The decor is old school, almost stereotypical, Sicilian. I got their iconic lasagna while my coworker got the gnocci al gorgonzla. The lasagna wasn't just cut out of a pan and plopped down in an unappetizing square as I expected. It almost looked like it was individually baked to order (of course I know it wasn't) and then dressed with a delicious sauce. The pasta was very soft but not soggy at all. I can see why this dish is so famous now.",,,

Shoreline, WA","During my 'staycation', I revisited favorite sites in Seattle's Magnolia neighborhood, one of them being Mondello. As mentioned from other write-ups, it is one of those underrated, flying under the radar established restaurants. It was time to update my previous posts from 5/18/14 and 3/15/15.
Earlier this afternoon (11/26/17) I headed back to Seattle via Bainbridge Island ferry, texted family members to ask where a family member's birthday was to be celebrated. Coincidentally, Mondello came up while texting.
We all decided to meet up in Magnolia Village at a nearby indie caf茅 since Mondello didn't open until 5pm on Sundays. We showed up a few minutes shortly after opening, warmly greeted, and seated at the same 4 top coincidentally from previous visits.
The restaurant's matriarch, Enza, wasn't perched at her usual counter seat. But instead, we had Corino Bonjrada, Mondello's owner, do the personable meet and greet as we perused our menus.
Beverages:
glass of Rosso della Casa ($9), Orange San Pellegrino soda ($3.50, with refill), and plentiful ice water.
Starters included:
Warm slices of house bread with herby dipping olive oil.
Antipasto Misto ($16) which had cured prosciutto and Parma (?) ham, cheese drizzled with balsamic vinegar, but no olives present on the serving board.
Bresaola ($14) which was one giant slice of cured Painted Hills beef. I ended up poaching both the arugula with grated parmesan and the greens from the antipasto plate, this made for a tasty mini salad.
Zuppa di Lenticchie ($12) with flavorful lentils, homemade sausage served in a generous bowl.
(Note: This much delayed post continued on 1/28/18, over two months later. Checked and noted menu prices went up slightly compared to this November 2017 visit. Details now fuzzy and receipt faded, my apologies fellow Yelpers.)
Main entrees included:
Pesce del Giorno (market price, $35)
Ravioli Marsala ($18)
Spaghetti alla Carbonara ($18)
Desserts included:
Tiramisu ($9) with an espresso ($3)
Limoncello ($9)
Affogato ($11, but comp'ed by the owner)
The celebration continued when two flutes of Moscato d'Asti was also brought to the table, gratis.
For a spontaneous birthday dinner decision, this was spectacular success! Thank you to
Corino Bonjrada and all of his restaurant staff.
Grazie mille!",,,

Kirkland, WA","Well....the service was very good. The homemade bread was unusual and very yummy.
The menu was very NON-CONDUCIVE for vegetarians. There were only two items on the entree menu and both were cheese-based. It's 2019 folks......there should be MANY choices for vegans and vegetarians.
The establishment was kind enough to make both of us a simple pasta dish with lots of veggies. We both asked for marinara sauce and our dishes came without any sauce, but rather in a clear 'soup'. We asked for sauce and a very watery and flavorless sauce arrived.
Both desserts we wanted were out, which was very sad. Why are they on the menu, if they're not available?
The biggest shock was the bill. We were charged the same price for our veggie pastas as dishes with meat or fish. Who charges $52 for two simple pasta dishes with no animal protein? Ridiculous.
We will not be dining there again. We have Italian restaurants much closer to home with rich red sauce and prices that are reasonable.

Primarily pasta but homemade pasta it offers up fresh versions of favorites. My son had venison meatballs and I had pasta puttanesca. We shared an octopus appetizer that was incredibly tender. My only suggestion would be to offer some shrimp as an addition to the puttanesca.
The restaurant is charming and on the small side, but we will be back.

I've knew about Mondello from their sister restaurant way back when several years ago! Just never trek it up here before. I mean I know La vita e Bella! I like the food!! Not crazy in love!!
But I guess this isn't the same! First: love the beautiful colors! Brought my mom for lunch here, we usually only do italian for family meals. Duh!! :)
Love: the gorgeous grandma that runs the spot! She's elegant! Spoke italian!! Si grazie!! Feel so home!!
Lunch menu was simple: fed appetizers! Several pasta and paninis. Pasta are basically traditional Sicilian dishes the classic like polpettes, carbonara and puttanesca. Nothing crazy elaborate! Though our neighbor tables swear by the ravioli in Marsala sauce! We went with our usuals!
Pasta vongole for moi! Always!! Love the wine and garlic parsley explosion!
Puttanesca with rigatoni has a nice kick!!
Fettuccini polpettes was good too!
Best part of all of this that got me squealed?? Fresh pasta!!!! It was love at half a bite. Ain't nothing like fresh pasta!! This is not the hand rolled but still it was perfect!! Usually I have to travel to my family in Rome for this much fresh pasta!!! Oh happiness!!!
I didn't even need my sauce to be honest!! Love it! So happy!! Too bad they don't have happy hour!! Or smaller plate options so I can try them all! Till then, grazie tanti per bella pranzo!!",,,

My sister ordered their chocolate decadence and we shared, I know I'm saying this a lot, but it was also so good!!! I don't know what was in it but it was so delicious and had raspberry sauce on the bottom. Just perfect! I think they make it in house too!

North Bend, WA","There is another Grazie in Bothell that we absolutely love, so we were really looking forward to trying another location. We stopped in here for dinner with friends and were excited to show them some of our favorite items on the menu but found out that they have slightly different menus actually. So we tried some new things instead of going for our usual favs.
This location is quite a bit smaller than the one in Bothell but is located in a great spot in between Seatac and the Tukwila mall, great place to grab a bite if you are waiting for someone to land. The beautiful iron center divides help to break up the one dining room and make it feel more intimate and the hanging stars from the ceiling and low lighting add a nice effect.
We were able to get a table quickly but had some issues ordering gluten free for me which was surprising because it was so easy at their other location. They did not offer the same gf items and the server wasn't really sure what was and wasn't gf as far as sauces were concerned, she just knew they had gf pasta. After some questioning I was able to order the mushroom spaghetti and the husband had the cannelloni.
We shared a caprese salad with our friends, which was a bit short on the basil but the mozzarella was nice. My pasta was just so so and our friends and the husband said the cannelloni they both ordered was okay but not super memorable. They didn't have the same gf dessert items as the Bothell location so we skipped dessert.
Overall, it was a pretty good place and I'm sure there might be other menu items that were even better than what we tried. Perhaps it was just our expectations coming from the great experiences at the Bothell location, but this one just didn't quite live up its sister location in service, gf availability, and overall taste.",,,

Seattle, WA","This is the definition of a hidden gem: located in the corner of a strip mall next to Men's Warehouse, I would have never guessed for this to be such an amazing Italian restaurant!
My husband and I are nuts over Italian food and ever since we came back from our honeymoon in Italy, we've tried finding a place that gives us that authentic Italian taste - this place is the closest we have found!
We've been here 3-4 times now, and my latest visit last week really compelled me to finally leave a review. We've always had an amazing time here, each and every visit. This last visit, my husband and I took both our mothers for dinner, and let me also say that this place is always packed! But luckily we were able to get a table for 4 with a same day reservation (probably because it was a weekday), though it was still busy.
Our server was so nice and patient with both helping make suggestions on dishes and also giving us enough time to decide. I got the Ravioli Ros茅 and added grilled chicken - it was DELICIOUS! Highly highly recommend. It was perfectly balanced, not too salty and made the perfect dish to pair with a glass of red wine.
For dessert, we all shared the tiramisu - also delicious. To top it all off, after we had left, my mom forgot her purse and our server actually came running out after us with it! He was a really good server, I'm sad I forgot his name. Regardless, we will be back! This is our go-to for authentic Italian food :)",,,

Creative, interesting use of flavors and sauces. Somehow, they managed to make spinach taste like a beautiful dream. And lamb, oh ...wow. So tender, I could cut it with a fork. Usually, I don't care for taste of lamb, it was truly extraordinary.
The ambiance is very romantic and cozy, servers are simply gorgeous (is that like a job requirement?),

It's a very small and cozy restaurant with little seating but it's worth the wait. We ordered calamari and this cheese marinara dip thing (can't remember the name) but oh it's so good. Cheese and bread can't get better than that! They also give complimentary bread with olive oil. Something about their seasoned olive oil is sooo good. I opted for the pear Gorgonzola ravioli with chicken and it doesn't skimp on flavors! Flavors here ARE NOT LACKING so expect pungent and rich flavors! I love love Gorgonzola so it was an amazing dish for me. I'd have to say too much chicken compared to the amount of ravioli which isn't a bad thing! My family's dishes were also really great and extra flavorful.
Dishes are on the more pricey side but imo it's worth the higher price point. Service is great and desserts are beautiful.",,,

Seattle, WA","I came in to Grazie with high expectations after hearing that their chefs train in Italy and good things from people I know. Because of this I suggested we try Grazie for dinner on Sunday night with out of town guests. Not all my expectations were met but overall a decent meal but with a little bit of a higher price tag than it deserved.
Service here was great. Everyone was super attentive, our water was refilled multiple times all without a prompt. Our appetizers and meals were quickly on our table so there's no issue with how they treat their guests.
The decor at Grazie felt a little off. For a place like this, I expected something a little more modern to go along with how they price their dishes but instead it felt like a chain Italian restaurant nearby. I also noticed a distinctly fishy smell in the air and I couldn't place where it was coming from, this above all was off-putting to me.
For appetizers we ordered caesar salad. The salads were well dressed and seasoned nicely but their dressing was super packed with garlic, to the point that our palettes were almost blown for the rest of the meal... and we love garlic. As for our entrees, nothing particularly remarkable about them. I had Pollo Al Limone, which was pretty much chicken piccata with artichokes. The odd thing about this dish is they serve it with their ""house pasta"" which is pasta with a tomato sauce. I've had a lot of chicken piccata (and dishes like it) and I have never seen someone pair that protein and sauce with something tomato based. It just seemed wrong to me. I wish they included more of a description of their house pasta on their menu because I would have asked for a substitution... or just plain pasta!
At the end of our meal, we got our checks and paid our bills. The server accidentally charged the wrong cards for the wrong bill. One of the amounts charge didn't even match a bill so we were not sure where that came from. We understood mistakes happen so we had no problem with him fixing the issue but he had to hunt down his manager to resolve the problem. I was uncomfortable with our credit cards being out for possession for as long as they were. The manager should have come to us and apologized but we never saw them.
Unless there's a happy hour special, I don't think I will be back. There was nothing remarkable that I tasted that I would crave to go back for. Their pricing is definitely higher than I think it should be, portion size is average. For example, $27 for their Pollo Limone is just too much.",,,

Windermere, FL","I wanted to like this place, I really did. But our experience went downhill once the server brought us our water.
First, the Chianti was mediocre at best. It had very little flavor, and the longer it sat and warmed, the harder I found it was to drink. It began to have an aftertaste that was unpleasant.
Next came the bread. Most Italian places we have been to serve warm, fresh bread. This was neither warm nor fresh. It wasn't even cut the whole way through, and we were not given a knife to finish the cuts. The bread was tough, and dry. The oil dipping mix was good, but it was lacking fresh ground pepper.
Our food was mediocre at best. I got Spaghetti and Meatballs, and the meatballs were uneatable, my husband got the Piatti (seafood and ravioli) - his seafood was over cooked and rubbery and his ravioli was under cooked. Plus the shrimp in his dish still had the tails on. Since the dish had pasta, the tails really should have had the removed. It makes for a very messy situation otherwise. The third member of our party got the Fettuccine Alfredo Chicken. The chicken came out mostly fatty pieces, and the fettuccine sauce had no flavor. Worst of all was the kids chicken meals. Pre-frozen Dinosaurs Chicken nuggets. Now, I understand how this might seem easier for the restaurant. But kids deserve to have food that comes without any additives. Every other Italian restaurant that we visit frequently offers freshly breaded chicken tenders.
Needless to say, when the server finally came back to offer dessert, we all passed and drove over to Panera Bread instead. We never got drinks refilled, and had to share our water with the kids in order to refill their drinks.",,,

We showed up around 6PM and it was very busy, but we were fortunately able to get a table after waiting for 5 minutes. It's not too big of a restaurant, but they were very accommodating to all party sizes and moved tables around frequently to seat people.
I have to say, the food was delicious! I started with the spinaci salad, which was a decent portion size for just $6. The salad was pretty filling with the egg, pine nuts, and pancetta. For my entree, I ordered the large size of the tortellini gorgonzola and added chicken. Wow, this dish was so good! I only ate half and the leftovers tasted just as good the next day. I can see how this dish is so popular. The gorgonzola was just the right amount and I wasn't sure if the chicken I added would work well, but it was really tasty and gave me the extra protein I wanted.
Service was good as well. Even though it was so busy, our server took the time to answer our questions and provide recommendations.

Decent spot if you are visiting Pike Place and you want Italian food without having to find parking again.
Food: 4/5 The food is exactly what you expect from any other Italian restaurant. Definitely more elevated than the usual chain spots like Olive Garden or Maggiano's. The food did take awhile to get to the table, but other than that everything was good but not extraordinary. I had the lasagna, and it was MASSIVE! I liked all the ricotta that was used to layer the lasagna and the meat sauce was savory and well balanced. My girl got the Linguine Di Mare which was good with its seafood-y flavors and nice acidity. We also shared the bruschetta which was good but might have been a carb overkill lol (if you like tomatoes though definitely try this)
Service: 5/5 Nothing to complain about here, the servers are all nice and attentive to your needs. It did kind of suck to hear that they were out of tortellini (I went on Sunday at 7:30pm)
Ambience: 4/5 Like every other review before me, the lighting in here is very dim. Good spot for a date with the slight pink lighting. Only thing I found weird was that it wasn't that busy so it was a little quiet in the dining room, but the bar seemed to be pretty lively (they close at 2am)
Overall, Good spot if you are in the area and want some solid Italian food without having to wait for a table!",,,

However, just be aware that the lighting is quite dim and this is not a quiet place! Most of the time we couldn't hear the background music and had to elevate our voices a little to talk. It didn't bother me so it won't really affect my rating but it may be an issue for others.",,,

Olympia, WA","We spend a week end in Seattle at Christmas. A highlight is a dinner at a nice restaraunt that has some character to it. Our favorite place recently closed leaving us in need for a new Saturday night dinner place. Through Yelp, we decided upon il Bistro. Great find, but.....
This is a wonderful setting, at the foot of Post Alley and the Gum Wall and in a classic basement bistro setting. The ambiance was super and just what we like.
The wait staff was friendly and prompt. However the kitchen and bar seemed ""behind"" and so our drinks and meal took a long time (more than casual, elegant dining speed).
I had the gnocchi, my daughter the ciappino. Both very good. In fact, my daughter tried a bite of the gnocchi and said it was the best she ever had!
My wife on the other hand, had the chicken dish and was very unhappey with the chicken itself. The sauce and fagioli were very good but the chicken tastless and ""an odd texture"". It was not on the level of the rest of the dish or our dishes.
We will likely give il Bistro another try as we like the restaraunt, but not for the chicken dish.",,,

Tustin, CA","IL Bistro is a slightly hidden, tucked away ""underground"" restaurant. It's super easy to miss because it's sandwiched in between the Gum Wall and a graffiti/""art"" plastered wall, both of which are so easy to divert your attention to. Even though it's in the heart of all the tourist traps, it feels like a mostly-locals hangout. In fact, we wouldn't have even found this place if not for a local - and we walked right past it the day before and had no idea we passed by it.
The ambiance here is super romantic - everything is dark and candlelit making it a great date night spot! It was pretty packed but they were able to seat us ""in the bar area"" (not actually at the bar, but a tinier table right by the bar) right away on a Saturday around 8 pm.
We just came for drinks and snacks since we ate earlier. Their drinks + cocktails list was pages and pages but luckily our server was super helpful in choosing drinks to our liking based on our alcohol preferences. Service was great - our server had a great vibe, checked up on us just the right amount, and did her best to personalize everything we ordered so it was just the way we liked it!
We had their Antipasto Misto (selection of salami, imported cheese, marinated vegetables) - aka a meat & cheese plate. On its own it's $16, but we substituted for burrata and added bread so I'm not sure what the total came out to.
It was a really good variety, with about 3-4 cured meats and a bunch of pickled veggies like cauliflower, carrots, olives, cucumbers, bell peppers. I just wish there was more cheese than just the burrata.
Overall IL Bistro was a super cool find and a great way to feel transported elsewhere - sitting here, you totally forget you're in Downtown Seattle!",,,
IL Bistro,(206) 682-3049,"Don M.
Calgary, Canada","When I'm on vacation I like to find ""famous stuff"": the lounges that the stars used to hang out in - or those places that all the locals rave about. My wife and I were thinking Il Bistro might fit the bill. It's been there for 30 years and It's located just off Post Alley. In fact the back wall is the legendary ""gum wall."" So we were expecting something amazing, maybe even legendary. The Yelp reviews promising an ""underground gem"" really fuelled our expectations too.
Based on the meal we had, I'd have to give it a rating of ""meh."" Certainly not worth $105 - which, with tip converts to $165 Canadian. I expect a memorable, or at least a good meal for that much.
The place was packed, and if you're looking for a quiet rendezvous you might be disappointed - especially if you want to whisper sweet nothings into someone's ear. While it's dimly lit (i.e. you can't read the menu without the decorative candle), cozy (low ceilings) It's louder than a Jr. High classroom the day before the school dance. We actually moved tables trying to escape the frat-party din.
Of course, all of this is minor if the food is actually good. We certainly didn't find anything to rave, or praise even faintly. I had the risotto, which was a cafeteria-style rendering of the dish. The predominant flavour was ""too salty."" Besides cheese and lots of salt, there was no real discernible seasoning, nuanced, layered or otherwise. My wife had linguini al mare - and the title was obviously taken too literally. It was swimming in a seafood ""broth"" best characterized, once again, as salty. I couldn't really taste anything else in the dish to even conjure a guess as to where the chef was going form. While I'm a big fan of ""letting the ingredients speak,"" in this dish they just kind of whisper, or gurgle.
We began our meal with unremarkable starters. A Tuscan bean soup - which, again, mostly just tasted like salt with a definite grocery-store deli vibe. My wife had a watery Caesar salad which, for the first time in our experience, had no garlic in it.
Between us we ate less than half the food. Surprisingly, maybe because they were busy, or perhaps because they're self-satisfied/arrogant, nobody asked, at any point, if we were enjoying our meal. Of course, I don't really think they cared, the service was brusque, cold and indifferent. Maybe we're too Canadian we expect nice.
In hindsight, I guess every city has those bland, over-priced, old school grad-dinner-and-anniversary Italian joints that people's grandparents really seem to love. This place definitely falls under this category.",,,

Decided to come take my lady here for Valentine's Day, after saying how great the place was, I was stoked.
I am sorry to say, I will not be returning.
Had a reservation for 9pm, got there a little early got seated around 9:10pm- No problem.
Ordered our bottle of wine, and our dinner course off the Valentines Day menu.
Wine came out and soon after, our appetizers made their way and we finished the the oysters in about 5 mins.
Waited on our first course.. waited.. waited.. ate the bread crumbs out the basket.. (never once came asked if we wanted a refill) 1 hour and fifteen minutes later our pasta & ravioli came out.
Bottle of wine- almost done by then. 炉\_(銉?_/炉
Waiter did not seem to have noticed or been phased whatsoever. ""Be careful it's hot.""
Thank you.
By this time I was a little embarrassed and told my lady ""This doesn't usually happen.. They must be back up since it's Valentine's Day.."".
By then the next reservation for 10 pm came in and a couple sat next to us.
Had a lot of time on my hands, hence- waiting for our main course and observed the table next to us.
They got their drinks and appetizers right away.
As they were just about finishing their appetizers the first course came out 10 mins after? ""Seafood risotto"" I believe.
My lady gave me the look..
Then, their seared scallops (Main course) came out soon after- before our main course even made way to our table.
She then gave me the look..
Hm..
Anyways, our main course made their way to our table. Mine being the New York steak. Then I realized the waiter didn't even ask me how I wanted my steak done when he took my order. I cut it, felt rubbery. Cut into it and was red. Took a bite it was the same temperature as my red wine. Nice.
It looked and felt like it was just sitting there waiting for someone to bring it to our table.
I was raised to finish everything off my plate and I stood by that, until this very night. Took one bite and left the rest, because by then I was already over it and lost my appetite.
Table next to us was ordering their desserts by this time.
Asked for the check as soon as he dropped off our steak and told the waiter I've been here a handful of times had a great experience, but today waited 2 hours+ just to have my main course, that's absurd.
He did his best in explaining the situation and said the chef had apologized in the back and that he would cut some of the added gratuity off our check. Also offered to pack up our desserts to take to go. Thank you, sir.
Paid for meal, said thank you to the waiter and headed out.

The bruschetta serving was huge, I split it with a friend and we each had 3 pieces of bread, but the amount of bruschetta that fell off when eating was at least 2 extra pieces of bread. All our dishes came out at the same time. The lasagna portion was also quite large, at least 4x4 with lots of sauce with veal and lamb, I could only eat half of it. It tasted great!

I wasn't seeing anything truly special and about threw in the towel and chose one of the usual suspects. Then, I found something about IL Bistro. The name wasn't familiar, so I looked into it a bit more. Little did I know that this was the place I'd walked past for years and years, always curious about the tucked away spot below the market entering post alley. Immediately upon seeing the photos alone, I felt butterflies in my stomach....this was most definitely the place. I booked a reservation immediately. The evening of our dinner, we took a nice stroll through the then closed and quiet Pike Place Market and he was sooo curious about where I had chosen because I kept it a secret. lol We began walking down into post alley and made the first left into this beautiful hideaway. We were immediately greeted by two very polite and funny gentlemen and lead to our table. I'd arranged for their romance package, so as we got closer he was surprised with rose petals and champagne waiting for us. Our server was amazing! Great conversation and not at all intrusive. Literally any question we had about an item on the menu, whether it be food or wine, she was able to answer in great detail. I ordered the Linguini di Mar茅 (linguini with mussels, clams, calamari, white prawns, market fish, in a white wine herb broth), and it was wonderful. Every flavor stood out, none competing with the other. The broth was very light and the entire dish perfectly balanced. He ordered the Agnello al Forno (roasted lamb sirloin, rosemary polenta, ratatouille vegetables, caselvetrano olives) and devoured every last bite....before making his way to my dish. lolol

While service and ambiance at il bistro are always wonderful, the food has gone dramatically downhill in the last year or so. On our most recent visit, the pizza came out cold, the pasta was undercooked and the Caesar salad tasted oddly like pickles. Very strange. The visit prior featured burnt pizza and unsalted prawns... it's a smorgasbord of culinary disasters.
Despite that we will probably be back because they're open late, staff is helpful, the bartenders are friendly and the prices are low. If the food was consistent it would be a more regular spot... fingers crossed it picks back up. We will keep the faith until then!",,,

Atlanta, GA","On Valentine's morning at 9:45, I started walking towards the restaurant with my friend to go stand in the queue. I was visiting from California, and my manager at work had highly recommended that I go to this place - he even let me take the morning off to go stand in the queue! So cool! He told me that this is not the one to miss if you're in Seattle, and given that it was my first time in Seattle, I thought I wouldn't let go of the opportunity!
After reaching the restaurant at 10:20AM, we were the sixth ones in the queue. I highly (very highly!!) recommend getting there at least 30 (and ideally 40) minutes before their opening time of 11AM. We were able to enter inside as soon as it opened. Definitely follow them on instagram - yummy posts of their daily rotating pasta and the prep process will make your mouth water every morning! I could not get myself to unfollow them. I love seeing how they make their pasta and with what! On Valentine's, they made a reddish pink beet puree pasta for the love theme - how cute is that!
I don't need to talk much about their food because their Yelp ratings speak for themselves!! The kale salad, as boring as it gets for salad-haters otherwise, is a treat! Do not skip it! My not-so-into-salad friends gorged it completely. I loved their madaline sandwich cookie that they sell by the piece! Very buttery and melts in your mouth. Focaccia is to die for - looks like bread but dissolves in your mouth like the softest cake. Everything is super, super affordable! Pasta ~ $10-11 and appetizers ~ $4-5 apiece. Love this about them! Keeping their game strong by creating this demand for their product, but despite the demand, not shooting prices up - thanks, Il Corvo! We love your humility!
Il Corvo has now switched to 100% take-out in the light of COVID-19 outbreak. They are a dine-in only place, so I am sure Seattle-ites really appreciate their favorite restaurant staying connected to them by taking this step.

Seattle, WA","Before Corvo Pasta, Ive only known T.V dinners and Cheesecake Factory ""pasta"". Therefore I did not like Corvo the very first time.
But since my first time, Ive learned to appreciate real pasta, and have developed a distaste for the garbage served at Cheesecake Factory and Olive Garden.
Corvo is AMAZING. Aside from my opinions, I've heard people mention that the pasta here is better than places in Rome. They have 1 main option thats served everyday (bolognese) and 2 rotating options. The bolognese is well deserving of non-rotation. And my favorites of the rotating options is the Rigatoni with cheese (im not sure which type, Sorry!) and spicy meat balls.
Almost everytime I come here, I get the kale salad. I did not like kale before coming here. Ill leave it at that.
The pasta is a deal here at 10.95 (previously 9.95). Portions may seem small, but its just an illusion. Each serving should be enough for an average eater.
Street Parking is a bit annoying to find and a tad expensive. But if you don't mind there is a public parking garage down the hill that charges 3 dollars per hour (street parking is $5/hour).
The biggest concern about eating here is the hours. Only open during weekdays from 11AM TO 3PM. And if you plan to come before 1:45 be prepared to wait in line. But thats the little secret with this restaurant. You can come at opening and wait 2 hours, or you can come around 2PM and skip the lines.
Overall, if you don't want to deal with the BS ""Fine Dining"" places that charge 20+ for some pasta, come to Corvo for some perfectly made, Al-dente pasta from an Award winning chef.",,,

My friend and I ordered the Lasagna and the Pappardelle but started with their kale salad. The salad was a good appetizer before we loaded up on carbs. A little heavy on the dressing for me but not too bad and definitely fresh and aromatic. Generous portions too, enough for two.
The pastas though are what give this place 5/5, inconvenient hours and wait aside. Of the two we ordered, the Pappardelle was better but both dishes had the same amazing chewy, soft, fresh pasta texture. It stands out the instant you bite into it. They also come with lots of fresh Parmesan cheese on top. If you're coming solo and need to pick one, I give the slight edge to the Pappardelle. The sauce packs more of a punch, is meatier, and more complex. I definitely hope to go again.",,,

Beaverton, OR","Fresh pasta and appetizers that compliment the dishes for a satisfying meal for a deal of 10.95 and change! Getting here early is the key because the wait time is due to the line and ordering because there is one kiosk station
Party of 2 waited starting 10:15am (first in line) and by 10:30 the line was almost to the end of the street. The two rotating pasta dishes are uploaded to Instagram before opening which is nice to see the daily options as the regular is a bolognese and doors promptly open on time
The line continues to move into the restaurant as you order at the counter- we got the lumache ""snail pasta"" that was in a turnip cream sauce and campanelli ""ruffled cone"" in a spring onion, tomato, arugula, and marjoram sauce. We also got appetizers of the kale salad, focaccia, and prosciutto. Before ordering, the staff was already plating various antipasti to serve and we got assigned a seat.
Tables are shared communally as the restaurant makes use of all the space. Utensils and water are self serve. Our antipasti was on our table before we even sat down and pasta showed up not even 5 minutes after.
Everything was fresh and made with love! The pastas were cooked perfectly and paired well with all three antipasti- especially the focaccia and kale salad. The salad was piled on in volume and the focaccia was soft and moist. Cured ham was a nice light pairing with the bread and even of its own with celery and oil. The lumache with turnip cream is one I am still thinking about and the campanelli had a hint of spice due to the arugula and marjoram.
With such fast service and turn around, we were done with our meal in half and hour and to go boxes available by the self serve station. Staff was around clearing plates, wiping down tables and checking everything consistently. Bus your own table and off you go. I can see myself coming multiple times a week to try the variety of pasta and pair it with various antipasti, the cookies look delicious too. Whether you try all three pastas or one at a time, you can't go wrong here. Definitely worth a trip when in Seattle",,,

The wait is inevitable, but completely worth it. Took us about 45 minutes until we reached the counter but the way their seating/service is set up, there seems to always be seating available. This is so great because it means you get to enjoy your pasta super fresh without the hassle of waiting on people to leave!
Once we sat it only took about 5 minutes to be served our pastas and wow did it not disappoint.

We got here around10:30am on a Friday and there was already a line almost to the corner. Still had to wait about an hour and a half before we got to the register. Luckily, the food comes out really fast.
All the food was freshly plated. We had the prosciutto and house focaccia. They were both exactly as one would expect. The focaccia was baked with some kind of herb and was pretty good.
The pasta came out really hot. We were ambitious and had all 3 pasta choices: the Bolognese, Lasagna, and Campanelli. The bolognese was okay to me, a little salty for my preference. My friend thought the Campanelli was really good. I don't like mushrooms, so I avoided it. The Lasagna was actually really good. I had to finish it. It was hot, cheesy, and perfectly flavored.
After you're done eating, you bus your own tables which can be difficult because it's a very cramped and crowded space. Honestly, the food is good but it's such a long wait, you eat in a cramped area, you have to wiggle your way through the restaurant to bus your dishes...might not be worth it if you don't really love pasta.

Finally made it out to this legendary pasta shop. I've heard only excellent things so I was excited to try their changing menu of pasta dishes. I ordered a pasta dish with clams and a lemon sauce which looked incredible.
First the pasta itself; it's amazing and totally worth it just to experience that alone. Good pasta is hard to find and I haven't had such great flavor and texture since I've been to Italy.
The sauces and ingredients used here really seem like top quality ingredients. The flavors are strong and compliment the pasta quite well.
The only downsides: the dishes tend to be on the salty side, but that could just be because I'm used to a lower sodium diet? Idk but most of my friends also agree. Secondly you don't get a ton of food so plan accordingly. 10/10 would recommend",,,

Unless you work in the area or have the day off, coming out here might prove to be a little tough. If you do decide to come here, let me advise you to come at 10:30, 30 minutes before they open. You'd rather wait 30 minutes outside than possibly 1+ hours outside.
The menu rotates daily and they only have 3 pasta options. The day we went, they had pappardelle, orecchiette and torchiette. If you're unsure what type of pasta each one is, they have sample ones in front of the cash register so you can see. We decided to get one of each since it's such a pain to get out here. The portion sizes aren't too big since it's lunch time so I think two people can easily finish 3 orders. The pastas are delicious! They're all cooked perfectly al-dente and perfectly chewy.

Seattle, WA","If you are trying to find the best pasta in Seattle. Its going to be right here. The line and preparing to wait in a lie isn't just the hype. The hype is seriously real. Please get the salad and focaccia if you're going to wait the whole time. I always get their bolognese because its just so good. I literally have dreams about the pasta and most importantly with sauce.
This place is truly unique because they post/ rotate their menu everyday and they only keep the bolognese. SOOOO GET THE BOLOGNESE.
Service is great and the resty is a VIBE.",,,
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,"Victoria C.
Seattle, WA","I've been so excited to come to this place due to all the hype around it. I might have come on a slightly off day though.
We came the day after Christmas around 10:45 AM, 15 minutes before they open. And they aren't kidding when they say if you don't want to wait that long to come around 10:30 AM to get in line. The line was long. And it might have been because a lot of people were off the day after Christmas, so why not come to get some delicious pasta.
You order once you get to the front, and the cashier will tell you where to sit. Like everyone else says, they do have a good system. They bring out pasta to you pretty fast, you eat, bus your own tables, and just get moving. There always seemed to be an open seat right when you got to the register. My husband and I got all 3 of the pastas, an order of the housemade focaccia bread, the kale salad, the proscuitto, and one of the dulche de leche cookies. The bread was the best part of the meal, although I do wish it was a little warmer. But I understand that they're trying to get it out orders as fast as possible. The kale salad was fine, as we the proscuitto.
When the pasta finally came out, we weren't blown away. To us, the base of the pasta dishes kind of all tasted the same. I was hoping the bolognese would be a little more flavorful, but it was just okay. They do have take out boxes for you to grab on your own as well.
For the line and wait, I probably wouldn't come back here. We didn't find the wait worth it honestly. The parking around the area is pretty scarce as well. There are some lots where you pay $10 an hour. Otherwise street parking is going to take you a little while to find.",,,

New York, NY","Absolutely loved the whole experience here.
We were in town for a few days to explore Seattle before our Alaskan cruise and wanted to hit up a spot for lunch where the locals eat. II Corvo was highly recommended.
As advertised, there is a wait and the line can be long. We got on it and patiently waited. Moved decently overall and we got in after a while.
You head up to the main counter and place your order. Staff is very friendly and will find you a spot to eat, even if there is a small wait until other diners finish up. It's not the biggest place and it was packed while we were there. Was told this is pretty much the norm. Even so, they found our group of five a table within minutes.
The delicious house made pasta arrives fairly quickly. You grab your own napkins, utensils, water, and clean up after yourself once you're done. Each day they feature different pastas. At only $10 a plate it's super affordable. We each ordered different pastas to taste and share. Loved it.
Oh snap that focaccia bread. It's pretty awesome. It's the crack of carbs. Dipping oil too. The kale salad blew my socks off. I hate kale, as do most of my group, but we fought over this bowl and devoured it.
One of the best lunch experiences we had while on vacation.",,,

1 hr 9 minutes later, we're finally seated. That line is deceiving though. You have your outside line... But once you get to the front you realize there's an inside line lol. Whyyyyyy?!?!
Anyways, once you make it to the front of the inside line, you order, find your seat, and staff will bring your food out. Once finished, bus your own table and be on your way.
Their pasta menu changes daily except for the pappardelle. We got that and the campanelli. Both had great flavor, and noodles were fresh and cooked perfectly al dente.
They'll seat you at any open table so you'll most likely be joining another party. Obviously parties of two are easiest here and it seemed most common.
Tldr: good pasta, long lines, not sure if it's worth that wait. I'll try again at an off time. Stay tuned.",,,

Renton, WA","We came on a Friday about 1 hour after the restaurant opened. I was absolutely amazed at the line that was already wrapping around the block and even contemplated on eating somewhere else.
We ended up waiting about an hour and 15 mins prior to order. To think I almost didn't try this place saddens me because what a one-of-a-kind this place is. We got their two daily specials as well as their kale salad. Both pastas were literally the most perfectly al dente pasta I have ever had- there is absolutely no doubt the lines are long!
This place opens only for 4 lunch hours 5 days a week. Each day, they make two to three pasta dishes with ingredients all different from the last (menu announced every day about 1-2 hours before opening on Instagram). Some dishes have ingredients I normally would not order in my pasta, but if Il Corvo made it, I would definitely try it.",,,
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,"Carol L.
Orange County, CA","BEST PASTA EVER! I would definitely give this place more stars if it were possible.
There is a long line, but most good places in Seattle do. I started lining up at 10:30 AM and got seated by 11:30. They don't let you save seats so you order first and a waiter will both guide you to an assigned seat and deliver the food.
One of the coolest things about this place is that they change their pasta menu daily. They have a classic pasta, which is always on their menu, called the pappardelle and it's amazing. The pasta is cooked to al dente and the meat sauce covers every little inch of that pasta. I still salivate thinking about it. Their other two kinds of pasta change daily according to what seasonal or fresh ingredients come about. You can follow their Instagram to see what the chef decides to make. Honestly, all their pasta are great though so I highly recommend you try them all. I also recommend getting the focaccia bread and the kale salad. They might not be on the top of your list of foods to try, but I promise you won't regret it!
All in all, everything was great from the food to the service. It's worth the hype and the recognition it gets. I'm currently still looking for something similar in LA, but have yet to find it. Really hoping they open a restaurant down here, but also a little worried that I would eat there WAY too often if they actually did.",,,
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,"Rebecca B.
Colorado Springs, CO","I was visiting family for the holidays and waited in line on Christmas Eve for 40 minutes starting at 10:20am before opening and have no regrets. There was a line to the corner block by 10:30. My little brother, an aspiring chef, made me watch the Eater episode featuring Il Corvo the night before, but it didn't take much convincing to wait in the cold with him in order to be one of the first customers in the door.
We ordered a feast of the kale salad, focaccia, pappardelle bolognese (the staple signature dish), pasticcio, and wine. The menu changes and Il Corvo announces daily what three pasta dishes will be served that day. Tip: check Instagram for updates. You can't go wrong whatever you order. The kale salad had a delightful crunch with a lemon dressing and generously sprinkled cheese. The house focaccia is unlike any focaccia I've ever had. There is no way to accurately describe the doughy, chewy, fluffy goodness. The quality and ingredients is unlike any other. The pasta itself was everything the reviews said it would be. Each pasta dish is reasonably priced at just over $10. I'm convinced I won't find pasta like this anywhere near me in Colorado and I'll be waiting in line again during my next visit.
My only regret about Il Corvo is that it is a quite small restaurant. Since word of its superior pasta has spread, there is a line that extends from the front register where you order and pay and wraps out onto the block. You will likely share a table (family style) in order for Il Corvo to serve more customers. I think this is actually a fun family-like environment but others may find it stifling as people bustle next to you waiting in line as you try to enjoy your food. Nevertheless, the pasta is worth it.",,,
Il Corvo Pasta,(206) 538-0999,"Rachel Z.
Fairfax, VA","I visited Seattle over Thanksgiving and decided to try Il Corvo after one of my friends raved about it. We arrived right at 11am on a Wednesday and the line was already around the corner! We ended up waiting around 1 hour and 15 minutes before we ordered our food at the counter. One thing that really stuck out to me was how reasonably priced the pasta was ($11 each). There are only 3 pasta entrees available to order each day. With a table of 3, we ordered 2 kale salads and one of each pasta offered that day: Pappardelle, Pasticcio, and Calamaretti.
The kale salad was really good. Not a surprise that almost everyone orders it. It's light and very refreshing. My favorite pasta was the Calamaretti, which had a really rich saffron and calamari broth. The Pasticcio was heavier and cheesy because it was baked in a pomodoro sauce. My least favorite was the Pappardelle because, despite the perfectly cooked pasta, the sauce was too dry.
Overall, I definitely think that the pasta at Il Corvo is great but I don't think I would wait in line again for over an hour to eat here. The atmosphere is also very hectic because there's a line of people through the middle of the restaurant. It's really crowded and because you have to bus your own table, it's a little bit of a headache navigating around the huge line of people when carrying dishes and glassware.",,,

Seattle, WA","The famous Il Corvo is someplace that has been on my list of places to try out for a while, and so to be in between jobs, it gives me a lot of time to go out and explore. SInce Il Corvo is only open for lunch, I knew I had to go as soon as possible. I went at around 1PM on a weekday and was expecting a huge line and wait, but when I arrived, there were only about 4 people in front of me at the door. Of course inside, the line extends, but I stepped inside fairly quickly. The place does get very, very crowded, but what I loved is that you don't have people waiting around trying to fight for a table. Once you order, the person at the register will tell you where to sit. People seemed to come and go at a pace that was easy for everyone to get seated right after ordering. They have that system DOWN.
We ordered the pappardelle and conchiglinie pasta dishes, and started off with the house focaccia and prosciutto di parma. The two appetizers came out almost as soon as we sat down. The focaccia-AMAZING. A must. Then prosciutto di parma was also DELICIOUS, and I would definitely order both again. The olive oil on the prosciutto was so fragrant ! The noodle dishes honestly, were not the BEST I've ever had, and I felt that I might have had too high of expectations, but they were satisfying. For the pappardelle, it was a little too hearty for me. I like pasta sauce to have a hint of sweetness, and the sauce for this dish wasn't that tomatoey. The cochinglinie was very salty and spicy, and it was good at first, but became a bit overpowering at the end.
I say that I would recommend Il Corvo to those visiting Seattle, and that the wait is worth to just try it out, but in terms of homemade pasta, there are other places that have the same quality for an equal price. Very good, and I will be back to curb my curiosity of their other dishes.",,,

However, I would not wait in line for over an hour to come here vs others in the area like Pasta Castalinga or Due Cucina, where there is no line. The pesto pasta and signature parpardelle were both good, and I love the olive oil they use here. Their open hours are only suited for people who are able to come at 10:45am, and even then it would be a 45 min wait before being able to eat. Not convenient. Good pasta.",,,

Santa Clara, CA","Out of all my memories from my trip to Seattle, my time eating here is one of my favorites that I hold dear to my heart. My partner and I were meeting up with my former roommate for dinner on a Monday night, and he said that a friend recommended this place so we made our way over.
We browsed the menu and liked what we saw so we were so excited to eat here. There was no one in the restaurant but we saw the light on and the chef so we waited. When the chef came to the door, he let us know that the restaurant was closed on Mondays. We were bummed especially since it was my last night in Seattle, but the chef was so hospitable, he invited us in and offered to cook for us. He said that he never likes to let people leave hungry. We took up his offer and came inside.
Chef Abe quickly fired up the kitchen and took our orders. We had lobster ravioli, eggplant parm, and saffron risotto. We felt kind of bad for him having to cook for us, but he was so kind about everything. Abe's wife arrived shortly after we arrived and quickly assisted us by getting our table set and with drinks. Abe gave us an appetizer of steamed spinach with balsamic vinegar and pine nuts that was absolutely delicious! My partner still talks about it months later and it means a lot since he does not like eating vegetables. All of Abe's dishes were to die for! The risotto was cooked perfectly and I commend him for that! After 3 years of a critical Italian ex trying to teach me how to cook risotto to the perfect consistency, I know that is a mastered skill! The sauce on the lobster ravioli was full of flavor and spices too! While we dined, Chef Abe was a great host telling us about his stories, travels, and we just had the greatest conversations.
At the end our dining experience Abe gave us some of his tiramisu to try and like the other dishes we enjoyed, it was incredibly tasty. This was truly the most hospitable experience I have ever enjoyed. The service alone left me wanting to come back to this place. Now I recommend this place to everyone I know who is going to Seattle.

The chef is a gem and treated our 7 person table with kid gloves coming over to share his opinion of the perfect Italian wine pairing and trading jokes and many smiles!!!

After Googling some dishes and speaking with our server, she suggested the Lamb Ragout Penne Pasta (minus the lamb ragout-vegetarian option) and the Gnocchi. We waited almost an hour for our food, which we weren't too upset about because the chef's wife mentioned that the bread and pasta sauces are all made from scratch. Let me just tell you, THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT. The food came out really hot, but it was delicious! I don't typically like gnocchi, but this gnocchi had a perfect potato ratio. And the penne pasta I had was surprisingly very good. At the end of our meal we were offered a slice of tiramisu, on the house (the chef also made from scratch) for having to wait so long. Tiramisu isn't my first choice when it comes to Italian desserts, but the texture was soft and sweet enough.

Atlanta, GA","We had just arrived in Seattle when COVID-19 had just started to circulate so the number of people roaming around had already started to dwindle. Luckily at this time, many restaurants were still open so we got to try a few places before the stay at home orders. Despite the changes, the Pink Door remained very busy. The bar was full, the tables were reserved. Luckily we weren't in a hurry so we grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar and waited about 30 min before we got our table.
As they state on their website, the Pink Door is built around the Italian ideals of simple, fresh and seasonal. Naturally, seafood has a prominent place on the menu. We started off with a few oysters to share (definitely worth it) and then into the entrees. Pastas were fantastic but I had my eye on the white salmon they had as a special for the evening. The waiter suggested it as a must try and, well, who was I to disagree? It was indeed a fantastic dish one that I would mind having again and again!
I imagine that during the day, the view would be pretty amazing but it was dark outside by the time we got there so we enjoyed our group's company. Too bad we didn't have room for dessert because I would have loved to give it a try! When you get dropped off here, you'll have to walk around to find it.

We've read many reviews about this place and it was also at the top of our list when searching for the best eats! I'm a big fan of Italian food, so I was super excited about this place. My boyfriend and I ordered two pastas to share and they were both so delicious. We got the Linguine Alle Vongole and the Pappardelle Al Ragu Bolognese.
Food: 4/5
Linguine Alle Vongole - $22
They do not skip out on the clams in this Linguine dish! I was trying to ratio the perfect ratio of clams to linguine, but ended up having so much more clams left. The pasta dish has a nice subtle flavor, but also strong in taste. I love that this was one of the first pastas I had that was made very light, yet tasty. Sometimes pastas without a lot of sauce can seem tasteless or bland, but this was definitely not that! The clams tasted very fresh and was cooked to a nice texture, nothing too rubbery or slimy. I also like that they give you a little bucket to put your clams, very thoughtful! :-)
Food: 4.5/5
Pappardelle Al Ragu Bolognese - $24
I visited Italy this summer and this was my favorite pasta. I was so excited to finally try it back again in the states and I'm not kidding when I say this place DOES IT RIGHT. The Bolognese sauce has so much flavor and the noodles were cooked really nicely. I usually prefer white sauce pastas more, but I definitely recommend this if you're a fan of red sauce or not!
Service/Ambiance: 5/5
We came on a Saturday night around 6:00pm and the wait was around 45 minutes. I definitely recommend doing an earlier dinner because a few minutes after, we overheard the wait time was about two hours.

The service was prompt and nice, which if you have read any of my reviews that is hugely important to me. The ambiance was as expected (moderate noise and low lighting) and we got a seat with a view! I imagine that happened thanks to Seattle slowing down right now, but it was a nice touch. They also have live music which I enjoyed a lot. Our cocktails were amazing. The cheese and meat board was fantastic as well -- although I would have loved more cheese! The tuna appetizer was tasty but not breathtaking. Our entrees are what gives this place 4 stars for me. They were good but not great. The market fish was a little dry and had a very fishy flavour to it. The duck was good but the farro was a bit tough. And the winter risotto was pretty bland.

We were seated right next to the jazz band stage and while they were taking a break, it allowed us to really soak in the atmosphere. I found myself smiling and intrigued simultaneously. I decided to order the Linguine Alle Vongole and we shared the Sicilian Fennel Orange Salad. Both dishes were masterful, flavorful, and light to the palate, which I prefer when it comes to Italian food. The live jazz band added another delicious layer to this whole experience.
Our waitress was delightful, cheery, and wonderfully efficient all night long. I may say this from time to time in my reviews(that I wish to return to try more of the menu from a certain establishment), but when it comes to The Pink Door, I pray with a passion that I will have the opportunity to return as soon as possible.",,,

Seattle, WA","I came here on a Friday night and it was very busy. I put my name in and was told it would be over an hour, but ended up getting seated within 30-45 minutes. I just went across the alley to The Tasting Room as I waited for our table to get ready. For appetizers, we ordered their grilled garlic bread and a half order of the antipasto. The antipasto came with meats, fresh cheese, pickled vegetables, and spreads.
For my entree, I ordered the linguine alle vongole aka clam linguine. This was very good and it came with a lot of clams. They give you a bucket to put the shells into and the whole bucket was full by the time I was done with my pasta. I thought this dish was very good and would recommend getting. Another cool thing about this place is they had live jazz music playing, which made for a cool ambiance. Overall, I would definitely come back here to try other dishes.",,,

La Puente, CA","This restaurant is absolutely stunning. It's classy and romantic. The band which plays jazz and funky songs from different eras and cultures only adds to the ambiance. We were originally seated in their beautiful dining room, but when we asked to be seated in the lounge with the band, they were able to immediately accommodate us with no problem. The service is so on point with the servers so attentive and even the bussers don't miss a beat. My husband dropped his napkin on the floor when he got up to use the restroom and they quickly replaced it with a new folded napkin on top of the table.
The food was delicious! The 1/2 order of the antipasto was still a fair amount. The meats, cheese and bean salad were so refreshing. The sausage and smoked mozzarella in the Fussiloni gave the perfect al dente pasta the right amount of saltiness, the pine nuts gave it a nice crunch and the Rapini added the freshness you need in a pasta dish. My husband loved his steak and it was cooked a perfect medium. I had my birthday dinner here and I felt so special. If I have the opportunity to come back to Seattle, I will definitely return to see their aerial dancers.",,,

I ordered the meat pappardelle and my boyfriend got a seafood dish.
I gave it three stars because my noodles were under cooked. They were stuck together and hard. For the rest of the noodles that were cooked, it was great.
So 3 stars for a pasta restaurant messing up on pasta. The seafood pasta was lighter and cooked to perfection.",,,

San Jose, CA","Worth the hype! Located right in the heart of Pike Place, Pink Door is one of the must-visit restaurants in Seattle. The space is vibey and the food is delish!
Reservations are a must since this place is so popular. If you do end up walking in, you might have to wait upwards of an hour and a half. There is no sign but you won't miss the pink door that leads to the restaurant.
For the food, you probably can't go wrong but I do recommend at least trying one of their meat/seafood dishes. The Special of the Day fish was the best dish I had!
Here's the food I tried (fave to least fave):
1. ""BRANZINO STYLE"" Whole White Fish of the Day: this was seriously amazing. I know they're known for their pasta but this dish blew me out of the water. The fish was so delicate and inside was stuffed with fresh crab. Every thing on that dish brought out the fish's flavor.
2. Lasagna Pink Door: Consists of fresh spinach pasta layered with bechamel and pesto, topped with marinara sauce, and baked. It's super creamy and decadent. Seriously a fave.
3. Pappardelle Al Ragu Bolognese: House made pappardelle with tomato based meat sauce topped with freshly grated Parmesan. This was good but not as good as the other two.
If you love bolognese so much",,,

It was a lovely sunny day and we got one of the last tables. There is a bit of shade, but we were mostly in the sun. The patio is pretty decently sized which was great. I wanted something refreshing since it was pretty warm out, so I ordered a seasonal watermelon margarita. It was definitely refreshing! Not super sweet and a great patio cocktail. I really wish we had been hungry, because the pasta dishes all looked amazing. I'd stop in again for a light lunch. The interior was a little weird to me; the decor was a mix of vintage circus/clown themed items. I probably watched the 90s TV version of Stephen King's It way too young but the clowns just creeped me out.

Reservations were booked 5 days out for dinner but I was able to snag a lunch reservation. We arrived right as the opened.
We were one of the first to order since I had already read the menu prior to arriving (I was excited for it). We ordered our entrees then were brought bread.
I had only one special request through the entire dining experience and that was a side of balsamic for the oil and bread.
Unfortunately it was not brought to me until I asked another employee who dropped off our entrees.
My boyfriend ordered the lasagna which he loved! He was very happy and I thought it was really good too.
I ordered the clam Linguine Alle Vongole and I personally wouldn't recommend it despite the rave reviews. I thought it was bland like plain noodles with olive oil. Something anyone could make at home. I like my clams with flavor but these were pretty plain. My boyfriend agreed after trying it.
Maybe the experience could have been saved with a different menu item and if we were there at night during the performances.",,,

I had made reservations 5 days before the night we dined here, but it was only for bar seating as there was no available spots in the dining room that entire night.
I was very surprised when we checked in with the hostess and we were seated at a table right by the stage, where the band was set up. When I looked around after we we were seated, I was very impressed with the decor and mood of this restaurant. The Linguine Alle Vongole(baby clams, pancetta, garlic, chili and white wine) was the best I've ever had. It was so flavorful, a little spicy, and literally every shell still had the clam inside. We shared the Sicilian Fennel Orange Salad(Cara oranges, red onion, watercress, castelvetrano, and oil cured olives). This salad was light, flavorful, and recommended.
Our waitress was amazing. She was so cheerful, quick, friendly, and welcoming. The band was playing old time jazz and it was very soothing. Overall, between the ambiance, food, and service, I was extremely impressed and I cannot wait to return to Seattle to dine here again.",,,

As a tourist, I wouldn't go here. First, it's hard to get a reservations and second it doesn't seem like a special ""only in Seattle"" type of place or serve food that you couldn't find anywhere else. With that said, if I lived here I would come back for that lasagna frequently.

Ambiance - Spacious, romantic, dim (but not too dim), amazing live entertainment and breathtaking views of the waterfront.
Food - A-maz-ing. After that Pink Door Lasagna, I went home and dreamed about it. For appetizers, our mushroom Crostini was delicious and you simply cant go wrong with some fries and aioli sauce. Portions were more than enough and there was flavor in every bite. Those zeppole doughnuts we ordered for dessert were absolutely perfect. That lemon flavor?!? Chef's kiss.
Service - Not even a second after my water cup was empty it was immediately refilled, and consistently done so throughout the night. The servers here really pay close attention to all their guests and we really felt acknowledged and heard.

Union City, CA","The Pink Door is as amazing as everyone else claims it to be! From the unseemly entrance to the beautiful view and decor, this place has earned its prestige as one of the best Italian restaurants around.
With a place that is so well known in Seattle, they are quite humble with their entrance. Walking thru a not so busy alley, if you see a Pink Door you've arrived at the right place. Upon entry, you can see the cozy intimate decor. And in the back they have a fantastic view of Pike's Place waterfront.
They have a great selection of items on their menu that are both exquisite and delicious. My GF and I ordered the Pink Door Lasagna, Special squid ink pasta with mussels and shrimp, Arancini and Tuscan Fries to share. The TUSCAN FRIES WERE AMAZING! They fry it with sage, rosemary, and garlic which gives it a subtle yet addicting flavor. The Arancini was quite good, but I was truly impressed by the Lasagna. Although it comes in a small dish, this is really all you need. Layers of spinach pasta packed with rich bechamel sauce and pesto and marinara was to die for. This is certainly one of those dishes you eat slowly to just savor all of the flavors.
This is definitely a must try for those who love Italian food or just want to spend a romantic night out with someone special. Just make sure to reserve a table early in advance.",,,

It's just a cute door painted bright pink that stands out from the brick and stone road. There is definitely a right and wrong time to go here as they get busy pretty quick. Saturday afternoon was almost perfect. We were seated promptly, waiting no more than 5 minutes. The ambiance was so cute - a mix of vintage with Italian themes. Their menu selection seemed a bit limited (1 page for food), but that just means they make everything fresh in house. The food was fantastic 10/10. It was fresh and flavorful. However, the portions were small and the prices were a bit high.
What made our experience not so great was that our waiter seemed to be rushing us as they were transitioning from lunch to dinner. We never got any bread, and they forgot the semolina gnocchi in my plate. Both sets of silverware also had dried food on them as well.

Linguine Alle Vongole | The signature dish of pink door! This pasta dish never goes wrong; the white wine broth really elevates and balances out the flavor of the clam. Love this simple yet delicate dish!
Cioppino | Never a big fan of tomato broths but this one's different. The amount of seafood is worth the price and the tomato broth is light and smooth, so you won't get tired of it!
Northwest Fish of the Day | Not a must order, but good quality fish! The salmon is seared to perfection with a crispy layer of fatty skin and tender meat on the inside!

San Lorenzo, CA","The Pink Door is straight fire.
Background: In Seattle for a weekend getaway with my wife this place came on my radar. We had wanted to eat here on previous trips but didn't make it. I knew this place must be the real deal because we couldn't even get a reservation for the Sunday of MLK weekend. Surrounding days only had reservations for like 9 oclock or later. Reminds me of The House of Prime Rib in San Francisco in terms of difficulty of getting a reservation.
The Wait with No reservations: We showed up at 8 and were seated by 9:15 at a great table in the lounge. While we were waiting we scored a couple of seats at the bar and had drinks. Time went by fast as we enjoyed our drinks. Bartenders were super friendly and accommodating. My wife can't have gluten and they were awesome about making her a lemon drop with a grain free vodka.
Ambiance: One of the coolest most unique places I've ever been. Great live entertainment, dim lighting perfect for a date night.
What we ordered: Drink wise we went with a lemon drop and an old fashioned (2). Great drinks.
Winter Risotto: My wife ordered this and really enjoyed it. It comes gluten free too which she was super excited about.
Lasagna: Man this was a straight smoke show. Damn it was delicious. Mind blown.
Mixed Greens: Solid standard with a vinaigrette dressing.
Service:Great all the way around.
Bread:Complimentary bread before the meal. So nice that they had gluten free bread for us.
Prices: I felt like they were super reasonable for the quality of food and experience you get here.
Final Thoughts: Such a great night out. Thanks Pink Door. If you can't get a reservation don't let that stop you. Show up about an hour before you would have made your reservation time and just grab a bar stool. Have a drink and take it all in.",,,

So we called the restaurant and the man who answered, maybe the owner, offered to bring the right food to us, as soon as he got off work. Not only did he bring our food to our door, but threw in two desserts and didn't ask for a penny more, Not only was the pasta and prawns, spaghetti and meatballs delicious, but obviously made with love!

Stevens, Seattle, WA","Spend an evening with Mike and you'll get one of Seattle's most uniquely cozy and fun dining experiences. He'll start by placing his big hands on your table and asking about your dietary restrictions, and then drop his signature, ""Are you ready for a beautiful dinner?""
And with that, the plates start coming. Things start slowly with salad and bread, then graduate to an array of dishes from eggplant to steak to mussels to cannelloni. I've experienced some variation in quantity, but proper planning for the 4-7 courses means foregoing the usual afternoon snack.
The food comes to just $35, though raspberry lemonade and dessert are hard to resist. Plan a full two hours. The pace and atmosphere will make you want to linger, and you don't want to miss any courses!",,,

Chino Hills, CA","I really hate to do this because the service was absolutely completely amazing from our waitress but the place was just plain ridiculous. My boyfriend and I are from out of town and we do try to dine at ""unusual"" or ""weird"" places when we travel. We experienced something like this in New York and were all down for doing it once again. However, this place was a joke.
There was no indication of prices throughout the meal at all, and while I knew what I was getting into with three dollar signs, I would still like to know how much the wine you just forced my boyfriend to drink is. Anytime the man in white came out he poured my boyfriend a glass even when he didn't ask for it. We didn't plan for a bottle, as we were driving after, we just wanted an aroma to our dinner.
I had no problem with the food, it was the fact I had no choice in whatever wine I ordered. Wine is a very specific drink when it comes to to tongue and everyone enjoys a different type. And not being able to chose which one I wanted that night was a bit rude in my opinion. I don't mind splurging on good wine, but $40 for something I can pick up on the discount shelf of Walmart is going to sour anyones mood.
Also, I felt bad for the servers at one point because I asked her what the dish I just ate was (because to be honest it was really good) and she told me she wasn't aloud to tell me. I would rather not go any further as I don't want to risk her job but to have to tell me that is no way to treat your employees.
As someone who grew up in a food capitol and experience different food adventures her whole life, this one was a fucking joke. As someone from out of town trust me, it's not worth it. But if you have some cash laying around give some waitresses some love they are amazing here. I hope they find some place where they are appreciated.",,,

Seattle, WA","Tldr; Disappointing. Amount/quality of food not worth the price point. Expect $10 worth of food for over $30 that takes forever to be served. Stay home, boil noodles, and use canned sauce; it's cheaper, faster, and probably more delicious.
The meal was absolutely disappointing
and I had some high expectations after hearing the concept. Over a period of 3 hours I had garlic bread (which was table shared in a basket), a single slice of eggplant with a watery pesto sauce, some strange sweet peach thing with a small pile of chicken, a plate with 3 shrimp, a slice of steak the size of my thumb, then one small plate of watery pasta with an insane amount of basil as the main course. You basically eat barely $10 worth of food then wait forever between dishes to give the illusion of being full.
Service-wise, yes it was great that they asked about dietary restrictions up front, but the absolute worst part was that as the night went on, people would come out with new plates but have 0 clue about the restrictions, so I would have to ask over and over if their was dairy in it.
Now that that's over, let's talk about this Mike guy that everyone seems to talk about. People have reviews about him being deeply involved in their experiences. He was basically non-existent for us, so I can't really relate to the insanely excellent experiences that everyone else seemed to have.
The absolutly only redeeming factor of this meal (if it's really redeeming) was the deserts. The deserts were actually super delicious! My parents would be so disappointed in me, because my dinner was such a small portion, I basically skipped it and went straight to desert.
At no point as well do you have any idea how much anything will cost. A $14 bottle of wine was charged for $33, and the deserts that almost seemed like they would be part of the multi-course meal were definitely not free and cost a decent penny.",,,

Very disappointed with the service. Have had amazing experiences past 2 times which is why we went to celebrate my husband's birthday with a group of 7. Usually we have got atleast a 5+ course and a dessert. This time we got a penne pasta, ravioli, cheese garlic bread (which is note really a main course) .. post which the server thought we should've been done and offered dessert. BUT we were still hungry and expected more, so she just REPEATED the pasta dish. We finally asked if we could get some chicken/pesto mushroom pasta (atleast a diff sauce base)!!!!
Did not see the main Chef Mike (I believe that's his name) for whom we actually went there as he is amazing. Not sure if this place has become too commercial or was it just a busy Friday night. I would def avoid weekend nights since it didn't feel customized (for which this place was my favorite) at all.
Love the place. Chef is amazing!!!!!!
There is no menu. The chef talks to u and understands exactly what you would like and are in the mood to eat and goes above and beyond to make a special customized meal for you. Make sure you let me know of any allergies or dislikes befo.

San Jose, CA","Came here for my and SO's anniversary dinner and had a rather disappointing meal. We were put on Pasta Freska (PF) by a co-worker of mine who lives in WA. We came on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't busy at all (maybe 2 other small parties besides us).
PF is located on the intersection of like three streets. We arrived at around 7PM and were seated right away. The gimmick with PF is that there really is no menu - the chef comes talk to you and finds your likes/dislikes/allergies and accommodates you depending on what you say.
For us, the chef or owner or whatever literally asked us, ""Ok what don't you like"". SO said seafood/spicy. Then he was off to the kitchen. When he came back, he slopped our first dish on each of our plates with no comment on what it was, or what the dish consisted of. Apparently we were just suppose to shut up and eat whatever it was. Next dish, same thing. I seriously had to stop him and ask wtf we were being served. I don't know if it was just an off night or if it was because the chef/owner's friends came by that night so he didn't give as much of a sht. But man, it really soured the experience for the both of us. For a restaurant with no menu, I was half-expecting the chef to describe what he was putting on our plates.
Luckily, another man, who was much nicer and conversational, helped us with answering our questions, getting us water, tea, and new plates (when ours were covered in previous dish's sauce). I liked that guy.
Anyways, all the food was really meh. I did enjoy the mussels and one (1) prawn tho. Everything else tasted phoned in/generic Italian/not impressive or stand-out. Without ordering any alcohol, our bill still came out to over $100. Wtf? Seemed overpriced for the tapas-style plates we received (refer to 8 pc tortellini and broccoli pics).",,,

Bellevue, WA","I asked around with some local ladies for a fun place to bring my husband for his birthday, and this came up with the recommendation ""if you like something unusual and you like Italian, this is the place to go."" Sold.
We arrived for our 6pm reservation to find we were the only customers in the place (it was completely full when we left a little over an hour later) and were taken to a table by our very quick and quiet waiter whose name I never did catch. The building layout is very unusual, but it ended up being great because it really isolated sound and kept it from getting incredibly loud for such a small dining room.
Chef Mike came to say hi and check to see what we couldn't have (Shellfish for me, Spinach for my husband), and if we prefer our food spicier or more mild. He brought me a glass of a lovely red (many people mention bottles, we weren't offered one nor did we request one) that I'm guessing was a Syrah blend but honestly I couldn't tell you and I had an impossible time trying to get an answer as to what things were.
The salad was fine; lettuce, goat(?) cheese, tomato, zingy dressing. I wasn't really here for salad so no complaints.
Round 1 was an Eggplant dish, Round 2 was Spaghetti, Round 3 was unidentifiable-- my husband got a plate of maybe pork(?) in a red sauce with broccoli in a runny white sauce that mixed unappealingly with the other sauce; I got some manner of stuffed pasta with a Spinach sauce, Round 4 was 4 mussels and a prawn for my husband and a breaded fish in white sauce for me. Dessert was a little sampler of three items.
We both enjoyed Rounds 1 and 2, round 3 we both hated and barely touched, round 4 was okay.
All told even with a full dining room we didn't feel forgotten or rushed. We both left full and wanting to visit again, service was spot on, but I'm REALLY not thrilled that I couldn't get anyone to stop and tell me what I was eating/drinking and what was in it-- if we do go back I'm going to be a lot more pushy about it.

Waipahu, HI","This ones a bit difficult to write. Five of us ordered take-out/delivery from this place. I had chicken pesto, my wife had chicken alfredo, and the others ordered spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, and seafood risotto.
This experience wasn't all that bad, and my wife and I actually got lucky with our dishes. I loved loved loved my chicken pesto which was near perfect. It was so creamy and delicious and had pieces of zucchini inside that were amazing. My wife's chicken alfredo was also amazing. I couldn't stop eating hers. Both of our pasta noodles were perfectly cooked as well. Lastly, the garlic bread was soooooo delicious. Sooo much garlic I was in heaven.
Despite the above, we had to give 2 stars based on the service... nothing to do with the taste of the food. The spaghetti was ordered with no cheese due to a lactose issue. Unfortunately, it was covered with parmesan which made it inedible. The risotto unfortunately had no risotto. It was regular pasta... perhaps angel hair? Lastly, they failed to include any utensils or napkins.
It was too bad. If the orders were correct, this might've been a 4- or 5-star rating. And perhaps this was just a one time issue. Moreover, if you actually ate at the restaurant, you would've probably avoided this experience, in which case the food would've just been delicious.",,,

It's a ""surprise dinner"" so after you tell them your dietary restrictions, or lack thereof, they just start providing you with an assortment of dishes and you have no idea what comes up! It's a fun concept and takes the thinking out of dining, but the reason I'm not giving them a higher rating is because the quality of ingredients they use isn't up to shape. The items in my list were Spagetti, chicken Marsala, eggplant lasagna, and the tiramisu dessert. Though dishes were well assembled and cooked, I think the ingredient quality took away from them. For example, though pasta had the right balance of ingredients, it had a similar taste to something I could make at home.

We were sat at a table and served wine before we could really get a word out and we weren't even ID'ed which I thought was strange. We had our IDs out and the owner gave us a weird look like we didnt need to show them to him.
The food kept coming and there were no menus. The meals are apparently ""customized"" but the dishes were what everyone else was getting as well. The food itself was terrible. We were getting nauseas after the 3rd course. I couldnt even identify some of the food. We finally asked one of the servers to box our next course because we wanted to just pay and leave. The owner also asked us if we wanted a refill of our wine and we said no. Five minutes later he pours us a second glass. We recieved dessert which was pretty basic but not nauseating.
Then the bill comes, it totaled about $110 for two people. Keep in mind there were no questions about what our budget was and no insight to how much these ""customized"" dishes cost. We were also charged for a full bottle of wine which we definitely did not consume. We were also charged an extra 10 dollars for desert...which we thought would be included in a 4-7 course meal. The owner came by and apologized for charging us for a full bottle of wine...and then told us to basically not TIP to make up for it.
So instead of just quickly refunding us and printing out a new ticket, he decided to screw over his servers who were definately pooling tip!

In this unassuming, triangle-shaped restaurant located just off Westlake Avenue N, you will find a meal unlike any other.
At first, you walk into the restaurant and are greeted by the friendly staff. If you've been here before, it's likely that they'll remember you. The server -- Taylor, Marcelina, or possibly Ali, the son of Mike the owner (sorry if I've misspelled any of your names) -- won't bring you a menu. Instead, they'll ask you if you'd like anything to drink, about your dietary preferences, and if there is anything you can't / don't like to eat.
Then, the meal begins. They'll bring you a bottle of wine -- whatever they think you'll like. And then comes course after course of delicious perfection.
As my uncle put it, ""The worst part about coming here is that you eat something amazing and don't know what it is!""
This is what I remember:
- Two bottles of red wine
- Salad
- Garlic bread (so soft and perfectly toasted!)
- Breaded rockfish
- Mussels, clams, prawns
- Eggplant parmesan (definitely the winner tonight. So good.)
- Chicken thigh with goat cheese
- Spinach cannelloni stuffed with fish and shrimp
- Canneloni with chicken
- Pasta (they bring this straight out of the kitchen and serve it from a big pan)
- Four assorted desserts (Flan, spumoni ice cream, chocolate truffles with cherry sauce, and some sort of mango mousse sponge cake)
And that's just what I remember.
We were so full we practically rolled out of the restaurant. Then we all waddled straight to our beds in a deep food coma.
You may expect all of this to come at some insane price -- But all of this came out to just over $200 for the three of us (including tax, tip, and all that wine). Perfectly reasonable for what you get!
Basically, you will love Pasta Freska if you like the idea of:
- A family-owned restaurant with a casual, friendly, and intimate environment.
- A multiple-course gourmet meal with no menu.
- Exploring and sharing good food with good friends.
You may not like it if:
- You are a picky eater with specific dietary restrictions.
- You are a germaphobe and don't like sharing plates with other people.
- You need a menu and the feeling of control.
Otherwise, I totally recommend Pasta Freska to anyone and everyone looking for a true Seattle gem.",,,

Bellevue, WA","Came here last night with my friend. I would rate as below:
Service: 4. All the staff were very nice and filed our water very quickly. It must be hard to keep track of all the tables though because things either came to the table a little too fast or came not quite hot. They fixed it by the 3rd course though, so all good there.
Food: 3 I liked all of the different dishes they brought out. Salad, bread, crab, eggplant Parmesan, and spaghetti. They all tasted okay but none blew my mind. The salad, bread, and the spaghetti were pretty much what you would get at any chain Italian restaurant, the eggplant Parmesan was a bit soggy and chewy. The crab was my favorite. Desserts were good. but seem like they were premade all at the beginning of the day.
Value: 2. For a bottle of wine and two dinners and a dessert, it was $128+tip and tax. The price of the wine, $44 is reasonable, but as someone who knows wine, the wine glasses are terrible and it's a small fix to get better wine glasses to get the full potential out of the wine. Dessert was an extra $9, which was not told to us. I would have liked the option to decide if I wanted to pay extra for dessert. So that leaves the actual dinner at $30 per person. With 5 small courses I would say the quality was not worth the $30 for what I would have paid $15/person for at Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo.
Don't think I'd come back with so many other great Italian places in Seattle like Artusi, Spinasse, Cuoco, etc.",,,

It is 5 courses of mouth watering, pure Italian, such flavorful food- all a surprise! You tell them your restrictions and then you get 5 plates of insane food to eat based around that. I said no seafood and ... I just. Have never had a meal like that. And, not to sound annoying, but I have been to Italy multiple times. THIS is authentic Italian on steroids.

Pasta Freska Restaurant,(206) 283-1515,"Itzel S.
Miami, FL","My husband suggested we try this restaurant after viewing the menu on Open Table and Yelp. When we got there and asked to see the menu, the waitress said ""we don't do that, you need to trust us."" After probing she provided a brief vague description of the process- Basically it's a Chef's Selection 5 course meal - then asked if we had any dietary restrictions. After expressing some concerns with the whole just trust us thing, she promised she would accommodate all of my restrictions.
We pressed on and decided to keep an open mind. We had to wait 15-20 minutes between courses. The food was average at best - oddly reminiscent of something you'd get from Chef Boyardee. Not to mention they serve it to you with ZERO description of what was just placed in front of you. I guess this is what they meant by ""just trust us.""
If that wasn't bad enough, over an hour in, while waiting for the third course, the chef/owner approaches us and asks that we could please get up and move because he'd forgotten about a large party that needed our table.
I personally feel that listing an itemized menu on places like Yelp and Open Table, when what they really offer is only a Chef's Selection menu, is misleading and confusing. Especially as a diabetic patron who needs to know what I'm about to consume in order to administer the right amount of insulin. (PSA: If you have any kind of dietary restrictions, please avoid this place at all costs)
Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment. The service was poor, the mystery ""meh"" portions were small and the entire experience was frustrating and confusing. If you're looking for subpar Italian food and mediocre service go to The Olive Garden - at least there, you know what you're signing up for.",,,

Seattle, WA","I have been coming here for almost 20 years, how have I not written a yelp review? This place is nothing short of darling and you are practically guaranteed to have a great experience. The main thing you need to know: no menus. You read that right, there are no menus. Mike, the owner and chef and sweetheart of a human being will come to your table and see what you don't eat. One person doesn't want shellfish? No problem. One person is a vegetarian? No worries. One person doesn't like any kind of seafood or spicy or long pasta or mushrooms? No worries. Mike has you covered. Once that convo has happened, all you need to do at that point is sit back and relax and wait for plate after plate of food to be delivered to you. There will be an appetizer. There will be a salad. And there will be other foods that will blow your mind. And without exaggeration, in the hundred or so times I have eaten here I've never had the same meal twice.
And do not forget to leave room for dessert! Flan, tiramisu, cheesecake, ice cream, cannoli - True to form you never know what you are going to get but it's going to be amazing.

Drove from Shoreline all the way to Westlake via 99/Dexter. Arrived at 1850 for 1900 reservations. All crammed at front entrance with no one recognizing our presence.

Seattle, WA","I've been going to Pasta Freska since 10 years ago and it hasn't really changed much. The decor is very similar if not the same and food tastes like homemade Italian food.
Pasta Freska is a great place to go to when you don't want to think about a menu instead of wanting to go somewhere you can socialize with some friends or a date. I wont describe too much of the experience because many Yelp reviewers already have.
I just have a few notes to make: one time I made reservations via their website. When I was there with a date, a server came up to us and I told them we had reservations. He responded with ""Really, are you sure?"" as if he couldn't find us. It was weird because I even had text proof that it was booked. He then said ""hold on one second"" and left. It wasn't until someone else came (I think the owner) that he asked how many we had again and sat us. It was kind of a weird situation.
Then last night, I went there with 3 of my friends who booked via Open Table and we got there at 6:30pm. There was at least 15 people in the front waiting and the host said they were running late and backed up. He didn't check or write anything down. So we got the feeling that we wouldn't be able to get our seats and after waiting a while, we left. The funny thing is, I used Open Table to find some other time tables elsewhere and Pasta Freska was listed with an open table at 7 pm, 7:15 pm. 7:30 pm, etc. which was clearly not going to happen... So I would suggest that you don't trust the reservations here and be prepared to wait. Otherwise come right when they open or on weekdays.",,,

Junction, Seattle, WA","Came here on a whim and left with every intention to come back. A few days ago, I walked past Antico wondering how long it had been here, it was empty and I was surprised since it looked new. My partner wanted pasta and we wanted something close but not our usual spots, in comes Soprano's Antico. A quick glance at their online menu solidified it for me.
We came in and there was one other table there, it was a group of 3 elderly men. It was very endearing. The decor is kitschy but everything was nice and spacious. The server/host/bartender was super nice and accommodating. I really liked her and how she treated everyone who walked in with so much genuine kindness.
Onto food, I had the Brooklynn calzone, baked with less cheese and more veggies. You also have the option to have it deep fried! She said it was really big and made for good leftovers, when it came to the table, I was pretty intimidated with the size...knowing I wouldn't finish it- I did though...despite everyone's disbelief. The calzone wasn't bad, I think had there been the regular amount of cheese it wouldn't have needed a little extra salt and pepper but it was good. The crust was really soft and crispy, the interior stayed hot the entire time I was eating. Gf ordered the spaghetti with marinara and it came with the best toasted garlic bread. The spaghetti was good, the noodles had a chew and the sauce had a nice sweetness to it. The restaurant boasts homemade pasta, so for the price points, it's worth it.",,,

All the entrees were delicious and the server told us the sauces as well as the pasta are all made in house.

I re/ordered with her. However when the pizza was delivered it was an X-Large instead of a large.

You can't beat the delicious food, quality wine, great views, and kind service. I don't think I need to say anymore, but I will.
Food: Superb Italian food. I've been here enough times to try much of the menu. You can't go wrong with the daily Tortellone. When I last visited it was filled with short rib and tasted perfect. I've also enjoyed their NY strip steak and Wild Boar Ragu. Typically I don't get appetizers because otherwise I get way too full, but their bruschetta is nice and refreshing when I do. Portions are reasonable but I almost always have leftovers to take home, just so I can save room for tiramisu. Honestly, I would come here exclusively for desert. The tiramisu is perfect in my eyes. It is rich and full of flavor.
Wine: Wonderful selection of quality wine. We always stick to reds and take the waiter's recommendations which we never regret.
Atmosphere: It's a beautiful view of the downtown Seattle skyline with the mountains in the background. The restaurant is on the smaller side so I always make a reservation, but I don't think one is always necessary.

Seattle, WA","I promised in my previous review to visit again and update my review. Here's the update. and it's good news. New owner. New chef. New passion.
Longtime That's Amore! server, Guy Devillier, bought the restaurant recently (started in March). A new chef, Richard Holdridge, was put in place in July. And the changes are positive.
On this visit, I tried the wild boar rag霉. It was tasty. The seasoning was unique and bold, and the flavors complemented each other. The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente. My only complaint was the hamburger texture of the wild boar meat. More on that in a minute.
I also tried the flourless chocolate torte for dessert. Another winner. Dark and deep chocolate flavor in a dense torte. Sounds like about half the desserts are made in house now. And the others are made by ""a retired baker who makes them just for us,"" according to my helpful server, Cindy. I'd still prefer all the desserts be made in house. Hopefully, they will get there eventually.
Cindy was an excellent server. She was informed, friendly, and helpful. I asked her to recommend the best dish on the menu, and that's how I ended up with the wild boar rag霉.
I chatted with Guy after my meal, and I was impressed by his passion and love for this place. For example, we spoke about the boar rag霉. He brought it up and mentioned they were thinking about making the meat larger pieces instead of the hamburger texture because the wild boar was too good a meat to make it into hamburger. I shared that I agreed and thought a pulled pork kind of texture would be great. It will be fun to see where the dish goes.
Which means, I will be back. This was a good experience this time, and I feel good about spending some of my dining money here. The passion's back, so please visit and fan the flames.",,,

From the Mt. Baker area, you can see pretty skies and some parts of the city! I ordered the Lasagna and it was delicious. The red sauce was well seasoned and put together.

Hinsdale, IL","The high Yelp rating attracted us to this neighborhood Italian restaurant. Nothing fancy inside which I'm driven to. They have a mostly Italian wine list. Took us a few tastes to find something we liked. Started with the Caprese Salad. This was the best part of the meal. Heirloom tomatoes, grilled eggplant, mozzarella. Everything fresh and a good sized serving for $12. The entrees were mostly pasta and started at $20. Had the Risotto Florentine. Spinach risotto with three large shrimp. The dish was smaller than I imagined as it was $26. To be honest, it was average at best. While the shrimp were good, the rest of the dish was bland and left me still hungry. We decided to skip the dessert after be underwhelmed at dinner. Possibly, I ordered the wrong dish? Maybe should have gone for pasta. Service was good but he never stopped back by to see if we enjoyed our meal. Guess he knew the answer.",,,

We were able to get a last minute reservation on a busy weekend night and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. They offered options for the children in our party, had a wonderful selection of wines to pair with every dish and an amazing view of the city.
Dylan was our server and he was such a delight, friendly and extremely knowledgeable with regard to the menu. Everyone was very happy with their dinner and we all are looking forward to trying something new the next time we are in the neighborhood!",,,

My husband took me here and in the reservation happened to say it was my birthday. They gave us the best service and were so kind!! Moved us closer to the window with the great view! Also the food was so tasty! They serve homemade bread and we got the risotto cakes which were amazing. The special was crab with parpidelle pasta was wonderful!!! Defn check it out!,,,

Walnut Creek, CA","WORST Italian food EVER, I regret selecting this restaurant for an important occasion.
It wasn't just me, every single person in my party was extremely disappointed with the food, including my parents visiting Seattle from another country, my bf who was meeting my parents for the first time, and my bf's sister, brother in law and little niece who drove all the way from Olympia. Yes we had a big table by the window and appreciated the nice view of the Seattle skyline, and yes our service staff was friendly and helpful, but none of that helped when the food sucked.
Look at my photos of the dishes, great presentation and plating right? That's what I thought too! And I couldn't wait to put the food in my mouth! But after I did my heart sank, and everyone saw my smile turned into frown. WTH? The wild boar was supposed to be slow cooked and tender but mine tasted like rubber. And no seasoning?? The risotto was hard and smelled funny (we suspected melted goat cheese was used in the sauce which wasn't listed on the menu), the chicken on top was again lack of seasoning, how do you call that a ""special""? I call it specially bad. And don't even get me started on the fettuccine dish, the feedback was that there was no trace of cheese which was supposed to be an important ingredient. Who was cooking for us exactly? Some intern chef? Ugh. I'm getting upset again as I'm writing this review, I could have picked any other place in the city and I'm sure it wouldn't have ruined a special night. Oh the bill wasn't cheap either.
Two lessons learned: 1) Trying a new restaurant is always risky, don't do it when you have an important occasion. 2) Good yelp rating doesn't always guarantee a good experience",,,

Springfield, OH","A true neighborhood restaurant, that's worth traveling far outside your neighborhood for.
To simply call this an ""old school"" Italian restaurant doesn't do it justice. It is old school in classic, sophisticated, but unpretentious setting. Even more so in the service, and how the owner and wait staff will treat you like you're an old friend of theirs who has been frequenting the spot for years even if it's your first time walking in.
But the food is something else entirely. Not only do they nail the classics (including the best chicken piccata you ever tasted), they're inventive enough to keep up up with any Cap Hill or Downtown joint you see on a Seattle Times best of list. Try their wild boar ragu if you want a perfect example.
Exceptional restaurant. Can't recommend enough.",,,

We found this hidden gem recommended by my boyfriend's friend. It was at the very top of Rainier in south Seattle. Such a cute, small little restaurant and if you're lucky like we were (twice), we got a seat next to the window with an amazing view of the space needle.
Easy to find street parking(free). No reservations needed. I got the pasta shrimp carbonara that was soooo good. This was our second time here and I am already dreaming about coming back more often. Seriously the pasta noodles are what makes this restaurant different. My boyfriend and I have found our favorite go-to for delicious Italian food. Our server was nothing short of sweet. Definitely recommend. We also left both our plates empty. No leftovers when it comes to us.",,,

The first time right after we moved to Mt Baker and was looking for a local date night spot and the second time we came here right before our marathon to carb up. Both of the times we got top notch service and the food is amaaaazing.
The first time we went here was before they changed their menu and the old menu definitely looked more like typical, classic family-style Italian restaurant whereas the new menu seems more modern, but they did keep lots of their old specialty dishes on the new menu. This time around i ordered the fruiti di mare - the scallops were perfectly cooked and noodles so al dente! We always finish with dessert, and the flourless chocolate cake is seriously to die for!!",,,

Seattle, WA","I. First Impressions/Backstory: Came to this place many months ago and was turned away because didn't have reservations. Called this place last week and spoke to someone who set up a table for 2, which was very nice. Came to the place and sat down, one of the waitress came to us and 'roared'.. 'Do You have reservations ?'. Felt odd to be welcomed that way - told her the name of the person I spoke to and Thank God she went away and WASN'T our waitress. The rest of the evening went well...
II. Overall: Cozy Ambience and Decent Food
III. The Food: Had heard a lot about this restaurant being the authentic Italian experience in Issaquah and so came to see for ourselves.. we ordered:
- Osso Bucco: Done well with the Bone Marrow intactt. Subtle Taste and mildly flavored. Nothing popped for me in terms of taste
- Penne Pasta: This was done very well. The balance between sauce and the flavors was good, not to mention the pasta itself done very well
- Home Made Tiramisu: Good Taste, softly flavored
IV. Service and Ambience:
- Service: Our waitress was super nice, very attentive and the exact opposite of the waitress who we had the misfortune of speaking to earlier and spoke like it was an inquisition.
- Ambience: This is a small cozy joint in downtown Issaquah. Thru the extent of the entire night Tony was on the Guitar and kept singing various Italian and other songs. He was very gracious, came to our table and took our request - made a big difference towards the overall dinner experience
V. Price Point: Average price of an entre is around $25 with highest priced item closed to $40 as well as a stellar collection of wines and more. There are better places that serve better Italian food and less expensive though..",,,

I could lavish about the Marsala Short Rob Ravioli or the masterpiece of a Sampler Platter but the experience is what I am most effected by.
You will need reservations. Because of this, you will notice most of the dining room will be seated within a short timeframe. You'll hear other conversations and soon wine and appetizers flow through the room. The air fills with laughter and warmth and then the entrees start to come out. The food is celebrated as it's delivered to each table and neighboring tables are showing each other the incredible presentation of each bowl or plate.
All along every need is anticipated and each guest feels invited. We can't wait to go back!",,,

Renton, WA","I heard of this place for a while and since it was on SRW, I figured it would be a good opportunity to check it out. The place is a little out of main Issaquah but it's nice cause you can find parking better.
When you walk in, you get greeted by the owner himself who checks on if you have reservations or not. Once you get seated, the waiter comes out to give you your menu to look at.
We got:
Gnocchi - super yummy, soft and the sauce was delicious.
Wild boar pappardelle - the pasta was a little over done for me but the sauce was delicious. You actually get pieces of wild boar. The plate itself was simple but it was delicious.
Canolli - the cream was to die for. The canolli itself was a little soft because it was dipped in chocolate. I wish it wasn't dipped in chocolate but it was still good.
We also got a Caesar salad from the regular menu and it was good as well. The complimentary bread was probably one of the highlights, it was soft and really good flavoring.
The only thing: they asked if we wanted distilled water or sparkling water. We chose sparkling but didn't realize it cost us $4.50 for the bottle. I wish they told us in the beginning.
Besides that, everything was good and I'm definitely happy that there's a good Italian restaurant in Issaquah",,,

Redmond, WA","Such a wonderful experience! My boyfriend and his family came here for his birthday dinner from a recommendation. The service here is top notch and I had one of the best services from the waitress here. We had a table of 7 people and the waitress brought our appetizer in two separate plates without us even asking so that it's easier for all of us to share. She was also very patient in answering our questions as we're not familiar with italian food.
Everything we ordered was amazing! Everyones number one favorite dish was the lobster pasts (they don't skimp on the seafood). Everyone elses second favorite was the meatball pasta, although my second was the seafood pasts. The meatballs were gigantic and had so much flavor! It was filled with a lot of vegetables and etc. The seafood pasta was a pink sauce, also very flavorful and filled with lots of seafood!
At the end of our meal the waitress brought out a bright hat and a glass of moscato for everyone (on the house) along with the guitarist singing happy birthday to us in italian.
This is the perfect place if you want to enjoy authentic tasty italian food with the best service. The restaurant is small which makes your experience more intimate. Thank you Montalicino Ristorante Italiano for your amazing food and service!",,,

Houston, TX","Solid 4.5 stars for this restaurant! It was a cozy intimate atmosphere with the red brick walls and the candlelight.. we had a party of 6 and they sat us in the ""mafia room"" which was a semi-private room on the back with the wine.. we didn't mind it one bit. It made our bday dinner a bit more private. The owners introduced themselves to us and they are so charming and sweet. They were so friendly that you can't help but immediately love them. The husband and wife team just recently took over the restaurant and it looks like they're doing something right cause the food is amazing.
We were greeted with some sparkling wine while we waited for our table to clear. We had reservations and the people were just finishing up when we arrived. No big deal since the restaurant is a bit on the smaller side. We were seated and started with the antipasto - wow what a plate! They charge you per person on this, which is why we had so much food! There were meats and cheeses, bruschetta, tomatoes and bufala mozzarella, giant shrimps, olives, etc. It was a lot, to the point where I wish we had less cause I didn't want to ruin my appetite for all the delicious pastas! The antipasto was delicious though and they packed it up for us to-go!
Pasta dishes, we sort of went family styled and chose a few dishes to share! We ordered:
*both salads - the Caesar and the mixed greens.. both were good. Nothing to complain about here.. though they were on the smaller side so a bit more difficult to share a good portion.
*Short Rib Ravioli - yum! The pasta had a good bite and cooked perfectly al dente. I always look for this in a pasta cause it's so hard to find. The short rib was fall off the fork tender and the flavors were phenomenal. Do yourself a favor and get this dish! 5/5
*Gnocchi came with a selection of a few sauces. We went for the sausage cream sauce. Again gnocchi were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious! I think one of my favorite dishes all night! 5/5
*Wild Boar Pappardelle - pappardelle is one of my favorite types of noodles! Good bite and perfectly cooked once again. Sauce was good but the other two won my vote for the night 4/5
*Pasta with Lobster in a Saffron Sauce - I think this was my least favorite dish of the night but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. It was fine, just underwhelming compared to its competitors. The lobster was lost in the dish and I felt like the flavors could be brought out more. I loved the seafood pastas in Italy, especially with the rockfish and lobster - cause omg seafood in Italy.. but the flavors of this dish didn't hit the mark. I felt like it had potential though cause I love a good saffron cream sauce! 3/5
*Homemade Cannoli, Pistachio Gelato and Tiramisu - the desserts were good but didn't blow me away! The cannoli tasted like it should. The Tiramisu needed less cream and more lady finger and espresso?! I wanted more of that kick and intense coffee and cocoa flavors. The pistachio gelato was my favorite dessert of the night. I think the dessert game could be amped up a bit, especially with the amazing pasta dishes!
Overall, I loved the food and ambiance here and have been recommending it to all my friends! Do yourself a favor and give this place a try, but remember to make reservations in advance cause it's small! Great for date nights and special occasions as well!",,,

Surprisingly authentic which is very rare; most ""Italian"" restaurants serve Americanized crap like ""chicken carbonara"" or ""pasta alfredo"". Had a very nice Barolo with the meal, which consisted of a house salad, lobster ravioli, and Osso buco. The lobster ravioli with a whole lobster tail was nothing short of phenomenal. Perfect balance of flavors and textures. The osso buco was equally top notch with the veal falling off the bone, super tender and flavorful. Also came with nice tomato based sauce and veggies. The after dinner grappa was on the house; nice touch.
Throughout the dinner the waitresses and manager were super friendly and attentive. There was a musician who entertained with Italian and other nice music.

After being seated, we were immediately greeted and asked how our night was going. Immediately felt welcome to be sitting in her section and never felt differently.

The pasta with butter and sage was very delicious. I'm not a pasta connoisseur so the finer points of handmade pasta are lost on me but it felt amazing in my mouth. Especially when you let it linger a little longer in your mouth than is necessary.
The ragu was my favorite pasta dish. I appreciated its savory contrast to the first buttery pasta. And our waiter suggested we start with the butter one before the ragu and we were thankful. It was definitely the right order of tasting.
I appreciated that our water glasses were kept full the entire night. I like to keep hydrated and we got the attention we needed. And the presentation of the food was fun too. The place itself was simpler than I imagined. More intimate than formal which was nice.
That Aperol Spritz also tastes real good.",,,

Seattle, WA","Food and drinks were all delicious, but not mindblowingly good as I had expected.
We got the following:
- Brussels sprouts in an anchovy sauce/reduction - kind of just like any Brussels sprouts you would expect at a good restaurant. I quite liked the anchovy but thought it was a tad bit too salty and overwhelming.
- stuffed onions - Honestly, these were my favorite. They were so flavorful. The assortment of bread that came with was alright. I wouldn't bother wasting your carbs intake on the bread, considering the amount of pasta you would eat.
- sage pasta and ragu - their signature pasta did vow me in terms of texture. I had never had anything like that before. The sage pasta was essentially all butter, not very sagey. The ragu was delicious, but nothing out of this world. I'd recommend half portion for both pasta.
The two whisky based cocktails we got were pretty strong, although super similar.
I'm still so glad I gave it a try finally. But I actually prefer Artusi next door. Or San Fermo in Ballard also delivers equally delicious food that feels more approachable.",,,

San Jose, CA","Soooo disaapointed from my experience here! I read so many good things about this place and was able to make a reservation a few weeks early for a 9pm slot. I LOVE Italian food and pasta so was super excited to try this place out.
We got the prosciutto for appetizer and since there were only 2 of us, the waiter recommended we get a half portion. We agreed and when we got it, we were so confused. There was enough prosciutto to feed a family of ten or more...it was just a heap of solid meat and 3 tiny pieces of pickled apples. I know, a large portion isn't something to complain about but it was just weird and proportions were off. Wish they gave ,ore pickles or cheese at least. It tasted fine though, but that's not where the disappointment came from.
I ordered the butter and sage tajarin and my cousin ordered the ragu tajarin. The pasta is supposed to be egg noodles handmade in house into light airy strands. The butter and sage one tasted like a less cheesy alfredo sauce with a very slight hint of sage. The pasta itself was super soft and I was not a fan. I like my pasta al dente, and usually will go for thicker pasta as well. Because it was so soft it kinda just felt mushy in my mouth. The sauce was underwhelming to say the least. I was sick of it after 3 bites. It was soo heavy and rich and one dimensional. I'm not sure how people are able to finish an entire plate of this let alone want more of it. The hint of sage was the best part but after a few bits it was just a chore to try and eat more.
The ragu one was a bit better in my opinion, the meat gave it extra flavor. But it really just tasted like an average meat sauce. I really was not a fan of the pasta though so it just ruined everything for me. Neither my cousin nor I finished our plates because it just was not worth the calories. The pasta was unique, sure, but it was just mushy and the sauces didn't make it any better.
There are better Italian places in Seattle, I wouldn't come back here unfortunately.",,,

Kirkland, WA","OMG - WOW. I have been wanting to go here forever! I tried to go a few years back on a whim but they did not have any seating left for walk-ins.
A few months back, we made reservations for a girls night. Best decision ever!
When you walk in the door on a weekend night, there is a nice ambiance to the place. It is somewhat dim and looked like a perfect place for a date, girls night, family dinner, somewhere for intimate conversations etc. The place is a decent size towards the small side and very popular; probably why it requires the reservation if you want to eat there that night and not chance it.
Making reservations online is very easy. You just have to remember to and make the few minutes to do it.
For dress attire: You do not have to dress up to go here but you definitely can. The decor is pretty versatile where you can make it what you want it; a fancy date night or a casual dinner out.
The waiters and waitresses are very welcoming when you walk in the door but also seem very busy attending to multiple tables. They visit the table often to see how things are and take your order. There wasn't a moment where you had to really wave them over even though you could clearly see they busy.
I wanted to try every single pasta on the menu. Everything was so delicious that I will be back, hopefully soon.
Here is what we did end up ordering and my thoughts. We shared every dish so that we could try a lot of things:
Antipasti: Both were delicious. If you are a fan of onions and meat, definitely get the Cipollini ripiene. It was so delicate yet meaty. If you are into bread baskets with different types of carbs, charcuterie etc. then this is the dish for you: Prosciutto di Parma. I love a good bread, spread & meat.
Primi: In the order of preference below.
Tajarin con burro e salvia
Tajarin al ragu
Tortellini di pastinaca
Risotto ai gamberi
The Tajarin was amazing. I love an in house handmade pasta. The noodles were delicate and fine just like the description. The Tajarin con burro e salvia was my all time favorite. I could have definitely eaten this whole plate and wanted more. Next time, I think I will end up order 2 smalls of the Tajarin all to myself it was that good.
The Risotto and the Tortellini were both good but didn't hit my palate like I would want to order either of them again. The Risotto a little more seafood tasting than I wanted at the time and the Tortellini just was heavier and more rich.
Contorni: I love a roasted carrot. Carote arrostite was really good and definitely worth a try for a carrot lover or anyone who is trying to add a veggie(ish) to the meal.
The experience here was amazing. I would highly recommend giving this a place to try, especially if you are a pasta person. You will not be disappointed if you come with the right price and size expectations.",,,

Cocktail list wasn't too expansive but they had something for everyone. Wine list is extensive and the atmosphere is pretty intimate. We had 5 pm reservations on a Tuesday and the place was packed by the time we left around 7.

Cascina Spinasse - Temp. CLOSED,(206) 251-7673,"Stephen K.
Bellevue, WA","Summary: If you solely come here for a specific pasta dish, you will leave satisfied. But everything else is as unmemorable as it gets- from the service to the house bread to the dessert to the $30 trout (more on this later).
Elon Musk. Stephen Curry. Bill Gates. The Backstreet Boys. What do these transcendent cultural icons all have in common you ask? They went against the grain. Against popular belief. And that is what I must do in saying, aside from one pasta dish, Spinasse is an average restaurant. To say I was hyped to have snagged a reservation on a weeks notice in one of the hardest restaurants to book in the city would be an understatement. And ya know, maybe the high expectations I came with me doomed my experience from the start so I'll take some culpability in the an overall experience that was just really average.
Nestled on the outskirts of Cap Hill, Spinasse exudes a romantic, intimate vibe from the moment you walk in. So at this point I'm thinking okay, this is my last meal with my significant other before they leave Seattle, and we gonna go out with a bang! Spinasse said nah, check yo self.
SIDE NOTE: It's a huge pet peeve of mine when restaurants try and make their menu a version of Webster's Dictionary Word of the Day that us peasants can't understand. Degustanzione, braciola, guancia, tajarin, barbabietole, who knows what these mean! Smh. But I suppose the Italian adds a flare to the authenticity and I'm probably just being dramatic since at least there are descriptions.
We ordered:
1. Tajarin con burro salvia (4/5 Stars) $15 small portion: The ICONIC hand cut egg pasta with butter and sage was light and flavorful. And it also tasted exactly like the Butter and Sage Gnocchi from Trader Joe's. The dish could have perhaps used a little bit more kick, but nonetheless I enjoyed it and marveled at the texture of such finely cut thin noodles. I've never quite eaten a noodle like that, and this brother has had a lot of noodles believe me.
2. Tajarin al ragu (5/5 Stars) $28 large portion: This dish was exemplary. The pork and beef ragu perfectly complimented the egg pasta, and even tasted a little sweet. And honestly, for all my asian noodle folks out there, the first thing I thought of was this meat tastes exactly like the mince pork of Rou Zhao Mian!!! Just Italian style. So that's probably why I loved it so much.
3. Agnolotti dal plin (3/5 Stars) $16 small portion: This is where the meal started going downhill. The agnolottis were absolutely tiny and filled with beef and pork. And while it didn't taste bad, the agnolottis were drowned in shaved cheese and left you feeling simply unsatisfied. I felt like I had to ration every one which was eaten in a half a bite because there were so few and each was so small. Granted we did get the small portion, but if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck, this ain't it.
4. Trota (2/5 Stars) $30: I almost fell out of my chair when this came out. Imagine a rectangle in your head, and and add a little fish tail to the end of it. That's exactly how the trout came out. I appreciated the fact that all the bones were plucked out, and the salsa of sage and golden raisins underneath was quite good- but the star of the dish is supposed to be the trout and it was so unmemorable. It had little to no flavor, and the presentation of a rectangle + tail left much to be desired. I was upset I didn't order another large of the tajarin al ragu with Trout money.
5. Torta al cioccolato (2/5 Stars) $11: The table beside us ordered this dish, and it looked SO APPETIZING. Plus I was desperate to salvage the meal and end it on a high note. And while the dark chocolate cake with buttercream wasn't bad, it wasn't good either. It tasted like a chocolate cake. It wasn't moist inside, but it was rock hard either. Nothing made me want to eat more, and I ate it out of the immigrant mentality of no food wasted upon which I was raised.
I would come back for the beef ragu, but that is it. I will also say our server again wasn't rude or bad, but she also didn't enhance the overall experience. She seemed a little disinterested and went through the motions, and did not provide genuine, heartfelt hospitality. Of course, we aren't entitled to amazing service by any means, but when a restaurant does have that amazing hospitality, it adds so much to the experience.
TIP: For $105/person, Spinasse has a deal where the table shares every single appetizer, pasta, and main entree dish on the menu (slightly smaller portions but still a good deal).",,,

Seattle, WA","Wow, their pastas are really really delicious. The noodles are really thin which really brings out the flavor. Based on the yelp reviews, we ordered 2 half order pastas (the ragu and the butter/sage), a kale dish, and the onion stuffed with meat. Everything was delicious and between the 2 of us, we were absolutely stuffed.
I loved that they offered reservations for a Saturday evening at 6:30PM. I also did make the reservation about 1 month in advance. Parking was really easy since it was an early dinner, and was able to find street parking right next to this restaurant.",,,

It wasn't grilled and for me I prefer my steaks that way, or at least with a little crusty on the outside. It seemed almost boiled. It had good flavor and you could tell it was quality meat. We got the garlic kale which was very tasty. Make reservations if you can since we went on a Monday night and had to sit at the bar. It was good though because we had a view of them hand making ravioli. Pasta is definitely the feature so stick with ordering that. Desserts were SO GOOD. I don't usually order dessert but I highly recommend.",,,

We ordered an abundance of items off the menu and it was all filling and amazing. I'm very excited to return here just for the food, the service of really wasn't that great. The server seemed very angry and kind of annoyed with us. It was probably a busy night so I am I don't blame him but he was a little disappointing.

Houston, TX","My friend loves this place and was absolutely adamant that we do our annual girl's holiday dinner here this year - so much so that even though the restaurant was booked, she called and left a message and was able to secure a reservation for us weeks in advance. I wasn't going to argue, I love pastas and homemade pastas are the absolute best! We had reservations during the holidays for a table of 5, and everything was set up and ready for us when we arrived. Parking wasn't horribly bad since it was on the outskirts of Capitol Hill, not in the mist of all the bars/restaurants/busy areas. We were able to find decent street parking quickly on a Friday night at 8pm. The restaurant itself is small and can be easily missed cause we definitely walked right passed it and had to turn around and walk back! It is a tiny little entrance right next to Altura, if you pass Altura by a lot, turn around! The is a double door leading to the interior to block out the wind, which is a nice touch. The interior is rustic and lightening makes it look like a candlelit tavern. The only complaint I had was the chairs - they were so so uncomfortable, it actually took away from my dining experience cause of how sunken the woven seats were and how erect the back was - please get new chairs!
Our server was quick and super friendly. We ordered a round of drinks, the Aperol Spritz was light and refreshing. We ordered 1 appetizer, 3 pastas, a main, and 2 sides to share between 5 girls and I thought the portions were definitely small. We were an ok full, but definitely not stuffed and could have maybe used a bit more food. The large pasta dishes were indeed on the smaller side, especially for the price. With that said, the pastas were good. We ordered the Agnolotti Dal Plin - little small pillows of delicious goodness. The tiny pillows were stuffed with such a flavorful concoction of meats and cheeses, beef and pork filled Agnolotti with a Double Brodo and Marjoram goodness to be excact. They were a burst of flavorful and the pasta was perfection (5/5). We also ordered the Tajarin con Burro e Salvia - basically a butter and sage pasta. Super simple but so much flavor. The tajarin pasta is Cascina Spinasse's signature dish - the super thin pasta is rare in most restaurants and Spinasse does it well. Lovely flavors of butter and sage, definitely the perfect ratio (5/5). And lastly, for the pastas, we ordered the Tajarin al Ragu. Again, an amazing ragu sauce with the right amount of cheese and the thin tajarin that just lets the sauce speak for itself. Delicious, albeit slightly on the salty side, just slightly. (5/5). My favorite dishes were indeed the pastas here - we also had two sides of kale and brussel sprouts - nothing to rave about there but a bit of greens to add to our carbo loading! The server recommended the Cipollini Ripiene - Roasted Cipollini Onions Stuffed with Beef and Pork Sausage with Toasted Pine Nuts and a side of bread as an appetizer and it was delicious! We had a friend who doesn't like onions but the mixture was cooked so well, you can't even taste the onions cause of the stuffed sausage. A good spread for the bread service (5/5). I also loved the amuse bouche, complimentary of the chef, the butter and anchovies toast was the most delicious mix and I would never think to serve butter with anchovies on top. Yum yum yum! I wish we could've ordered this dish alone. And our last dish was the special of the night, Pork Belly with Potatoes. The pork belly was tender and flavored well, though it wasn't my favorite dish of the night. The restaurant definitely stands out cause of the pastas!
Overall, good experience and lots of delicious dishes. Pastas, amuse bouche and appetizers were all fantastic. The sides and pork belly fell a little short, though definitely not bad by any means. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the panna cotta - by far the best panna cotta we've had in a long time. The tiramisu was in a small jar and was just ok - I think the panna cotta just stole the show! Service was good, ambiance homey, but chairs need to be replaced for comfort!",,,

Seattle, WA","I want to start by saying that this is my most favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've tried many pasta places in the city, but Cascina Spinasse is my go-to. I even designated this spot to be my birthday dinner restaurant!
I am absolutely obsessed with their butter sage pasta. I don't know what it is about this dish, but it's so delicious. I could literally eat this every day.
I've had several dishes that I thoroughly enjoyed, but the butter sage pasta is what always stands out and what keeps me coming back. I don't think I've had anything that I didn't enjoy here. They also have amazing desserts. The last dessert I had was their tiramisu. I'm not a huge tiramisu fan, but I enjoyed theirs. It was so flavorful and delicious.
The only thing that bums me out about this place is that it's so popular and sometimes challenging to get a reservation in. Sometimes we go as early as possible to see if we can get bar seating. It's usually a hit or miss, but if they can fit us in, I'm generally down to wait for them to clear up some space.
If you're into delicious, freshly made pasta like me, you need to come here! But I highly recommend calling ahead to see if you can get a reservation. Otherwise, try getting there really early when they open for dinner to see if they can fit you in.",,,

Waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable! She helped us pick out a glass of wine, and gave us complimentary anchovy crackers. Bread and breadsticks were also complimentary for our meal.
We ordered full versions of both tajarin pastas: butter & sage and pork & beef. Waitress explained that the half portion was about the size of a baseball, and since we were pretty hungry we just got both full portions.
Pasta was extremely light and airy. We had read Yelp reviews before about how the pasta melted in mouth - this is true and verified. The pork & beef was a bit salty, but my boyfriend's favorite. I vote the butter & sage, so much that when the waitress asked if we wanted dessert, I just asked for another half portion of the butter & sage tajarin instead LOL.
Highly recommend from the attentiveness of the waitress and of course the pasta itself.",,,

Service: Terrific and professional - almost fine dining-like.
Food: Ordered the appetizer - squash with bacon and nuts on it; thought I'd needed this one because I assumed the pasta wouldn't be enough. It was yummy but I actually didn't like squash as much. Ordered the beef ragu pasta and OMG it was toooooo good! I would order this again and again. I heard the butter and sage was also delicious!
Pricing: Be prepared to spend a bit more than your usual fare for dinner or lunch. This place is pricey - their service and quality of food makes up for it as they should if they are going to charge that much.
View from the Bar: If you are on a date or just traveling solo - I recommend sitting by the bar. I really enjoyed watching the workers make the pasta live! It was so fun to watch!

The pork and beef ragu on top of the egg noodles were good, but a little bland for my taste. I've never had a cabbage salad that tasted so good. The prosciutto and egg added great texture and blended well with the crunchy cabbage. I'm not sure what kind of dressing was used, but it was delicious. The trout was crispy and full if flavor. Finally, the prawn risotto was amazing and a must try! I was so full and didn't have room for dessert.

One of those small, intimate settings with the dim lighting that I appreciate, but that means no photos for you guys;) The plates looked tiny, but is actually very filling so I recommend you getting a few of the half size pastas for more variety.
Going back to the butter & sage pasta, literally all my clients have been raving this so I've had it on my radar for a while now. I think they used actual angel hair because it was magical. It's one of those food porn moments, where it enters your mouth and might explode from all the bomb flavor.
Highly recommend coming here for any special occasion; birthdays, anniversaries, death of evil boss, or if you're a foodie like me and love exploring new places on a random Tuesday to avoid crowds, although this popular spot is busy all the time.

Seattle, WA","I had high expectations going into this, and I was not let down. I get nervous when I have to give a credit card in advance for a reservation, but I was dedicated and ready to commit. This place had been on my list for a while. OpenTable only had reservations very late in the evening, and when we called via phone (the horror!), they were able to accommodate seating us earlier, which was amazing because I was exhausted.
It has a dark ambiance. I don't know what rustic actually means, but maybe it was that? The table was ready and set up when we got there, so that was appreciated. The server was very cool. And that didn't prevent him from being very polite and providing excellent service throughout the meal.
The bruschetta was not what I typically think of when I think of bruschetta but it was amazing. The tajarin is one of their staple things, and I enjoyed that. The cavatelli with braised beef short rib ragu was definitely to the next level goodness. At this point in ordering food, I was nervous that I wouldn't be able to eat more, but somehow that wasn't an issue when the food came out and ordering the pancetta was not a mistake.
We ended the meal with this chocolate torta thing that was so balanced - it wasn't too heavy or overly chocolately. And the grappa pairing that they recommended was so on point.
I will definitely be coming back. I appreciate the great service, the recommended pairings worked really well, and all of the dishes that were ordered were consistently excellent.",,,

Three employees, one of them a manager, walked up to the station, looked at a paper, turned and walked away. NOT ONE PERSON said hello or even made eye contact.
The waiter was more like a part timer. She was friendly, but was paying more attention to something else.
The food was mediocre at best. Not bad enough to complain about, but certainly not even close to Beverly Hills. The saving grace was the complimentary bread - it was Great.
The waiter realized that we got the short end of the service and brought us a complimentary dessert - which was wonderful but it was too late.

My partner and I ordered a pasta and pizza dish, so that we could both try each. I had the spinach ravioli, he had the pork sauce based pizza - the exact name is escaping me at the moment. Regardless, holy-moly they were so good! Great flavor for both entrees and we spoiled ourselves with dessert.

Il Fornaio in Seattle is, unfortunately, pretty forgettable. It's possibly a touch above Maggiano's or Carrabba's, but there's not a lot to say about this location. They seem to be somewhat stuck between authenticity and Americanized Italian, and ultimately fall between the cracks as a result. I would think that, being so close to an oceanic coast and having so much fresh seafood available, the restaurant should focus on highlighting the advantages of its location (understanding that it is a small chain).

Seattle, WA","Made a reservation for 8 and the host asked me if it was a special occasion. I told him that it was a ""why yes it was, my in-laws 50th wedding anniversary"" When we arrived I reminded the host that it was a 50th wedding anniversary. They walked past the center table set for 8 and stuck us in a corner next to the kitchen. (That other table was finally filled with 6 people about an hour later). I think they looked at our mixed race family (white, black and Hispanic) and judged us that we shouldn't be in the center of their nice space. Another AA couple was stuck in a corner.
The waiter was nice but didn't say happy anniversary or talk to my in-laws at all even though I told him that we were celebrating such a big event. The host did not seem like he was making it special as I hoped the waiter would.
After we ordered appetizers, drinks and dinner (they forgot my steak knife and made my husband get up to finally get me one because my butter knife wouldn't cut it-I happily tried) the waiter asked if we wanted dessert. I said yes and he brought me a menu. I finally asked, do you do anything for ""special occasions because you guys asked me if it was and marked it on our reservation?"" He said 'oh yeah. We could give you a spamoni gelato ' ok. So I ordered a few more desserts so we could all share some.
Not once did this restaurant make our special occasion special. I told the young, dumb and broke host that his table choice was rude. We might not look like we are well off or tip well but we DO and even if we didn't it's their integrity in their service, (btw-I tipped 20% because it was work to serve 8 people and I'm not rude). Also my medium rare steak was not red at all in the center. I didn't want to dampen the night. I will be calling the manager but I doubt he/she cares. We shall see if they even respond on Yelp.
Update : the manager doesn't seem to care that we came for a 50th wedding anniversary nor that they asked but treated us like we should be sat by the kitchen and not treated kindly or like the special occasion that it was. My in-laws are the kindest people. Too bad no response. Changed from 2 to 1 star 2/5/19 after no response from the manager.",,,

We came in on the late side for dinner, and our server was very nice and flexible with our annoying orders and additions--lactose intolerance, type 2 diabetes, just a lot of special dietary needs.
Ended up trying the cucumber cooler cocktail, Margherita pizza, Caesar salad, meat ravioli, and goat cheese flatbread appetizer. Family got the white chicken rigatoni pasta and the seafood sampler dish, which came with two kinds of fish, shrimp, calamari, and a veggie side. The dishes are expensive--more than 20 a pop so it adds up fast, but they were relatively good. I say I'd probably skip the ravioli next time. The pasta was too firm and there weren't enough to warrant 22.50 price tag. Since every main is about the same price, I feel like even the white chicken pasta bowl was a better deal.
The flatbread was good. Crisp and topped with tomatoes and red onion. Cucumber cocktail was weak. The best looking dish was the fish sampler. Pizza is typical Neapolitan, so soggy/soft and wasn't the best leftovers. Their bread and oil/vinegar is delicious--the bread has a great crust and the inside is so tender...it's delicious and wonderful for sopping up extra sauces from your main.

We had a sleeping child in a stroller and were looking for somewhere we could take the stroller, unfolded, inside. They were completely understanding on this point and seated us in quiet corner with our stroller.
My butternut squash ravioli with fried sage leaves was excellent. The dish featured large, soft, homemade pillows of pasta and there was a circle of very fresh tomato sauce in the middle. They kept the fried sage leaves out of the sauce so that they were crispy and easily paired with a bite of ravioli. I especially loved that touch.

We both had pasta and pizza both times, I wasn't too impressed with the pizza the last time, this time around was better. We both really enjoyed their pasta dishes (Penne vodka and butternut squash with brown butter and sage). We also decided to order an appetizer salad plate, which was nice, but could have used a little more something. It was plain lettuce with some parmesan shavings, I think a couple of tomatos, olives and other items could have added to it. The salad was too simple for the price we paid.
Service is always slow, we got seated and someone brought us water, another person a basket of bread and than no one else came for about 15-20min at least? We didn't know who our waiter was, so we emptied the bread basket and were just about done once the waiter showed up.

The restaurant is worn. Walking upstairs to use the bathroom I noticed a terrible stench coming from the carpeted stairs that have clearly never been cleaned.
Bench seats and repairs with duct tape. Slivers abound with the worn tables. And they no long validate parking.

We started with a glass of Prosecco.
The bread was served warm and it was so delicious.
I often say you know how good the food will be by the bread they serve!!! We ordered the halibut Special of the day and the seafood linguine with marinara sauce ...both dishes were to die for!
So tasty ! The seafood linguine reminded me so much of the dish in Rome..delizioso!!! We ended the meal with our favorite cappuccino. We were too full to order dessert...perhaps next time

Call me silly, but I love the starched tablecloths and napkins. I love the sweet, street-front locale. I love how the waiters seemed to actually pick up on when we were deep into a conversation and wait before dashing in with whatever ""special"" was oh-so important for us to know in exactly 12 minutes after we were seated.
It is the epitome of a lovely bistro. The Caprese salad was fabulous, topped only by the Stracciatella Alla Romana (an amazing soup, just saying).

Staff was attentive and provided good service. We got the Caprese, bolognese, green pasta crepe with spinach, and a spicy penne pasta. For dessert we got the Tiramisu.
The Caprese was done very well. Ingredient was fresh and the dressing was excellent.
All of the pasta dishes were also done very well. They were all very delicious and it is hard to say which one I liked best. Note the Penne Aglico Olio E Spinaci is a tiny bit spicy, so might not be good for children.
Tiramisu was also very tasty and a good end to our lunch.
So why the four stars? Well, the garlic bread that was served to us at the start of the meal was cold and over half of it was burnt and left a bad impression. Otherwise, we had a great experience.

We ordered a half bottle (cool that they have this option, although next time I'm ordering a full bottle) of Brunello di Montalcino. I highly recommend this wine. Don't let the rust color weird you out. The flavor is amazing- deep cherry flavors, medium to full bodied, and dry.
For dinner, I ordered the cioppino. I love seafood so it was an easy decision. The sauce had a strong garlic flavor and had a little heat to it. It came with fish, clams, mussels, and scallops & garlic toast points for dipping in the sauce.
My partner ordered the linguine with norcina (Italian sausage, cream sauce, black pepper, and parmasean). That was also very tasty and satisfying. If you love Alfredo, you will love this. The Italian sausage adds a nice spicy kick and fennel flavor.
Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner. Our server was very nice and informative. She informed us that our bottle of wine, when ordered as a full bottle, is not that much more (more value for your buck).
The only small criticism I have is that food was a bit slow to come out. The prices are a bit high (I guess I should expect this since it's in Kirkland) for staple Italian food.",,,

If your looking for a good quality veal dish, do yourself a favor and come to Paradise Restaurant and try their ""Scaloppine al Funghi"". A delicious thinly sliced veal with mushrooms in a white wine sauce. You have the option too with a side of mix veggies or pasta. The texture and taste of the overall veal was just right.

I feel bad that they are probably so underpaid when they are doing more work than our lazy server who could care less about us. My additional star is for them!

Kirkland, WA","We decided to try this place on Valentines Day for the first time as we were craving Italian food and have walked past this place a million times. We had a reservation for 7 pm, but as we entered we saw a crowd of people waiting at the front door and once we checked in, they told us they are running about 30 min behind schedule...yikes...not something you want to hear, but it was a very busy night for restaurants in the area so we weren't too mad, plus they had a great attitude about it and were very apologetic.
We got seated and a bread basket was placed on our table with some butter which I have to say was THE BEST free bread I have ever gotten at a restaurant. It came right out of the oven, still super hot and crunchy, but fluffy on the inside. I ate way more bread than I should have. We ordered the Antipasto All'Italiana meat, cheese, and marinated veggie platter which I liked, but I thought could have been presented in a more elegant manner. I also ordered the lobster tortellini which was very delicious, cooked well, and had a wonderful cream sauce...although it was a bit pricey. There were 5 pieces of tortellini and the dish cost $28 dollars. For dessert, we ordered the sour cream cheesecake with raspberry sauce and it was SO good, it tasted like it was home made and the raspberry sauce was so fresh and delicious.
The restaurant itself has a great vibe. It is on the small side, but feels very cozy and intimate. It really reminds me of a restaurant you would find in Italy.
Overall, once our waitress got to our table she was very friendly, got our food out to us quickly, and was very lovely to us despite how incredibly busy they were. Although there was a bumpy start at the beginning, in the end I felt that his restaurant did a great job with food and service.

Service was good, they were attentive with refilling our water and bread and made sure everything was good.
Food wise, I definitely had better. We had the following:
Bread: probably the best thing we had, it was soft, warm and light. We had two servings of these because its so good, went well with the butter as well as the sauce from the pasta dish.
Antipasto all'italliana: few slices of different deli meats, a couple slices of provolone cheese and some grilled veggies - $15. I thought it was just ok, standard charcuterie plate, a little pricey but nothing was bad.
Linguine Tutto mare: pasta with mixed seafood of clams, mussels, prawns and scallops in marinara sauce -$22. The pasta was not Al dente yet, still kind of on the firmer side. Some of the seafood was still Sandy and gritty so they didn't clean it well. Finally, the sauce was on the bland side.
Overall, it was ok, definitely need some improvement, except for the bread. It is on the pricier side as well, so a good place to try, but not my cup of tea.",,,

The place is nice inside, and our waitress was very friendly. The food, unfortunately, was just not very good (especially for the price). We ordered the polenta fries (odd texture with a dipping sauce that didn't pair very well), a butternut squash pasta dish (just generally lacking in flavor) and the squid ink pasta (it was over lime-y in an unpleasant way). Overall, everything was fairly bland and underwhelming. Also, the service was pretty slow. (We had an 8 p.m. reservation, we ordered right away and I remember checking my watch at 8:40 wondering when our food would arrive).

I'm not going to go through each dish, because almost every course we had was fairly bland and uninspired. The truffle risotto was excellent, but the rib eye, while good, was under salted. Or if it was properly salted, it was around 75% of what it could've been.
I know this is my most negative review, and I truly want to be fair and constructive when it comes to reviewing restaurants, but this experience has the largest discrepancy between the price you're paying vs. dinning experience. We've eaten at Copine, Tilth, and Rock Creek Seafood. Those places left our minds blown with flavors I've never tasted before. I was waiting for that to happen with each course and it pretty much was the opposite.

I ordered carbonara, first of all it's not the traditional carbonara, it's weird to use this type of pasta, there were some water left in the pasta and made my dish very watery, I am glad they made it al dente, but there was no flavor at all. On the other hand, the bacon is full with flavor, I personally loved it but it's so greasy and did not mix well with the pasta. It is kinda of awkward to eat this dish, so be prepared to eat it with forks and knife. My friend ordered the same dish, he has the same opinion.
The homemade tiramisu is okay, It's also not traditional tiramisu that tastes like coffee, it tasted citrus instead,I could not taste the coffee, the cake a little dry, and it's too sweet!
The environment is pretty nice and there's a cute tree in the middle.

Seattle, WA","I came here with a friend because she was trying to use a gift $50 gift card before leaving the area.
We arrived right as they opened and no one was in the restaurant besides us for the first 15 to 30 minutes we were there. The waitress took a while to take our order and the food took a bit longer than I'd expect given that no one else was there.
I ordered a smaller pasta for $16, my friend ordered a larger pasta plate, and we ordered focaccia with oil to reach that $50 mark.
The food was good. The olive oil had a little too much salt in it but it tasted good besides that. I couldn't really taste the pasta but the sauce was flavorful.
The portion size to price ratio is ridiculous and I would say not worth it. We did ask what the sizes were before ordering so we had a vague sense of how much we were getting. The waitress said the smaller portion was for sampling while the larger one was more of a meal. For $16 I hope you'd get more than a sample, and normally wouldn't have gone for that option, but we were trying to use the gift card, so we bought more.
When the bill came, my friend tried using the gift card and was told that the restaurant couldn't accept it because management had changed a couple months before and my friend would have to use it at (I think) Tilth.
The waitress was nice about it but the response on behalf of the restaurant seems unprofessional. There was no notice anywhere about the change in management or that the gift cards couldn't be used here. I would assume I would be able to use a gift card with the restaurant's name on it at the restaurant without having to check if it's a valid form of payment. I feel like good customer service would have been to accept the gift card and notify us for next time, especially since we bought what we did because of the gift card. This can all be chalked up to lack of communication, but as customers, this doesn't seem like a thing you'd normally have to communicate.",,,

The service was really slow even though there were barely anyone in for lunch, and in the two hours we were there our server didn't ask about the food once. We had to wait for while for our food too, and when he came back it was only to refill our waters and give us the check.
In terms of food, I had the daily special salad, which had an arugula and red cabbage base with almonds, figs, burrata cheese and grilled chicken (added for $4 more). I thought this was a very innovative salad and liked it very much - the only thing I was missing was a little more acidity from the dressing. I think they should have added a bit more of that. My chicken was also good but a little burnt, and they used chicken breast that wasn't boneless, so there was less meat than it looked like.
I wasn't able to take a proper look at the rest of the menu since we ordered rather quickly (the server came back very fast and my coworkers that had been there before us already knew what they wanted), so I might come back to sample that since I love Italian food. But it won't be my first pick.",,,

1. Tiny portion for the price we paid
2. Waited for almost 90mins after ordering, even though the place (I wouldn't call it a restaurant) is only about 20% full. It feels like the server is also the cook? I don't know, but I am pretty sure it would take me less time to buy the ingredients from the PCC across street and cook the dish myself.
3. The pasta tasted like yakisoba from next door, but this place charge you triple.
4. We got tricked into ordering soup/salad. Yes, there was the fine print about how much the soup/salad cost, but the way Kurt the server asked made it sounds like it was a combo that come with the pasta.
5. Kurt the sever charged us extra, both in the item price and in tax (he charged the tax based on subtotal+tips). He know we are in a rush to get back to work. The seasonal pasta got charged $1 more, and the spaghetti marinara got charged $4 more. What a scam.
6. I would like to say something to Kurt the server, but due to the general guideline of Yelp, I am not gonna say it here.
7. I hope this place get closed, so there won't be more victims from their scam.

Seattle, WA","I usually love Agrodolce! But this was the first time with its executive chef Thomas Litrenta as owner - he bought the place from famed chef Maria Hines last month. It was one of my lunch picks for Seattle Restaurant Week Spring 2019. I arrived at 12:30pm, there were only six seated tables, more than a dozen open tables, yet I stood waiting at the front for almost five minutes. There was only one person managing front of house and table service, he needed help. Even though there were many wide open tables he said there might be a wait because it was Seattle Restaurant Week and they were holding a lot of tables (I note that no one else showed up after me, and lunch service ended at 2:00pm). Luckily he sat me anyway. The appetizer dish of grilled asparagus with pepper sauce and homemade burrata was the best appetizer of all SRW offerings I had during the week. I could have eaten three servings of it. The server/host recommended the tomato rigatoni entree and is was, sadly, very disappointing and downright not good. The sausage was overcooked and hard, the pasta might have been good but the texture was like it was overboiled and then sat under a heat lamp for too long, strangely tough on the surface even though mushy on the inside. Then as you reached the bottom, there was just too much oil/sausage fat pooled at the bottom of the dish to be appetizing.
I love this place normally, so it had to be an off day, but SRW should put better since I think the idea is to capture people who might not otherwise try a place. I'd hate to think that someone might think this was their best foot forward.",,,

When I asked the waitress what kind it was, she was not sure and smelled it! The portions were extremely small and the sweet potatoes were under cooked. Everything took entirely too long to come out and when we received each course they were all slightly warm at best.
Aside from all of that, our waitress was extremely chatty and down right inappropriate. I won't get into what she said to me, but it was enough to offend me.

First, my wife told them she was a vegetarian in the reservations, to our waiter when we sat down after he asked and they still served salad with bacon on it. When she said something, the waiter said that is how it comes, they did take care of her after she looked at him and said I can't eat this.

We started with the Caramelized Broccoli, toasted almond, chili flake, anchovy vinaigrette. This is a special of the house and it was excellent. The portion could have served 4....so we took home what we didn't eat.
For our entree we had the Squid Ink Chitarra, dungeness crab, preserved lemon, pickled pepper and bottarga. Very different and excellent.
Our second entree was Coffee Flour Pappardelle & Sugo....beef, pork, lamb, hourse marinara, mama lil's peppers....excellent. We shared some of each entree. Two very different flavors.
For desert we shared the Lemonchelo Tieramisue which we shared and was excellent.",,,

Seattle, WA","My wife and I met up with friends at Agrodolce for Seattle Restaurant Week. We started with a bottle of wine that was a little too acidic. After 30 minutes our appetizers showed up. Two of us ordered the mushroom arancini. It said foraged and found mushrooms. I guess the foraging didn't go well, because we didn't find any mushroom flavor. My wife ordered the local roots beet salad. They brought her the arancini as well and did not seem to believe her when she said she had ordered the beet salad. We all heard her say it. I am not sure why the waiter did not. Another twenty minutes and her salad showed up.
My wife enjoyed her salad. After another 30 minutes the entrees were served. My Braised Lamb was quite good. My wife's choice Bucatini Sarde was not bad. The other two in our party had the Chestnut Rigatoni. It was flavorless and the gluten free pasta was quite awful. They did not ask for gluten free pasta, that is all that was offered with the dish.
For dessert, three of us had the Theo's Chocolate Caramel Budino, which was very tasty, but served with a tablespoon that was larger than the ramekin.
In the two hours we were there, the waiter only spoke to us to take the original order, doubt that my wife had ordered the beet salad and mumble thanks when he dropped off the bill. Was it because we spoke Spanish or because of the order mixup? No, he seemed to be that way with everyone. He clearly did not want to be there. No problem, the place was half empty on restaurant week. We won't be back again. Soon enough he'll likely have his wish and not have to be there anymore.",,,

My fungi pasta was perfect. Not too oily, not too cheesy. One can tell that they've spent a long time considering appropriate ratios for all ingredients to be apparent in the final presentation. I've had lesser pasta with too much oregano or garlic overpowering everything else.
I mentioned to them that I was bringing it home for my lady and I believe that they added extra food into the to go box to give both my lady and I a helping. That's that famous Italian veneration of family showing through.
We had our pasta with a nice bottle of semillon. It was superb and a much needed distraction from the post-apocalyptic zombie movie set that downtown Seattle has become",,,

We were all so thankful that Luigi's was ose by. It was amazing! Real Italian feel and the pasta was cooked perfectly! The flavours in the meat and sauce was perfectly done. I'm just salivating thinking about it again. I could pass on the Caesar salad next time; it was just a little too saucy for my liking.

When I walked in, it was kind of full. We had a reservation. Instead of ordering our own plates, we chose the the Italian Table (price ranges from $30-$50 each person). The nice lady said that would be a good choice and it'll be family style so we can try more items. It was a great choice because the food was delicious and we left happy and with leftovers aka lunch for tomorrow.
The atmosphere was fine, we enjoyed our visit. There were papers scattered on a table that seemed like a table for the employees in visible sight, but I guess that really gave it a family restaurant type of vibe.",,,

Immediately, we felt at home and welcomed as it was our first time here. My friend was from Spain visiting and she has been to Italy many times. She couldn't stop talking about this fun and decadent experience after it was all over. We will definitely be back!!
The delight of the experience is that you don't know what's coming out but you can tell them what you prefer. The courses that came out were so amazingly good and unique in flavors to one another that it kept our pallets dancing and guessing our next adventurous bite.
The service was very attentive and warm. I'm pretty needy when it comes to water refills FYI and I was never left thirsty. They explained each meal as it arrived and the whole experience was a delight! Thank you so much!!
We mistakenly stuffed our faces on the first 2 courses so we got so full by the time the main course arrived. It was so good!! They packed the left overs in to go containers very well and made it easy for us to enjoy it later. Thank you!!",,,

Seattle, WA","It's been a while since we've stopped in to this local, Italian restaurant. And I feel like it honestly might be my last time, unfortunately.
I'm at 2.5 stars right now. It sucks because I really want to like this place so much. And it isn't that the food is terrible, either. The portions can be on the small side, but their cream-based pastas and their carbonara are consistently good. However, about half of their menu items are hit or miss.
We stopped in recently on a Saturday afternoon to grab a late lunch and the place was pretty empty. We were seated at a table that had water all over it from the pitcher there for us to refill. Menus were placed on our table and we were asked right away if we wanted drinks. We asked for a drink menu and the waiter told us he ""was the drink menu."" Okay? How am I supposed to know what to order if you have no indication of what cocktails, wine, and beer you offer? I asked for a red wine and so did my fiance. The waiter then immediately asked us if we were planning on having more than one glass and if we wanted a carafe instead. We stupidly said yes without any mention of price or size. $32 later for house wine and I'm a little pissed that there was no mention of price from the waiter after he offered, ESPECIALLY since they have no drink menu.
We then ordered our food and while we waited, we noticed the the staff was sitting around for 75% of the time we were there. It seems weird that a restaurant's staff would just be chillin' on a Saturday. Any restaurant or bar I've ever worked in there was ALWAYS something to do and there was NEVER a reason to be sitting around. When our food was dropped off, I was bummed that my ragu was bland. But my fiance liked his carbonara.
When we got our check I was shocked to see that 1) a carafe of house wine is $32 and they don't tell you that and 2) there is a 20% SERVICE CHARGE. And not just for large parties, but even for 2 people dining--no matter how the service you received was, or how the food was... I'm not kidding. There is no signage or warning of this anywhere in the restaurant that I saw. As someone who worked in the service industry from a long time, I'm a big tipper. But what they're doing here at Luigi's is absolutely unacceptable.
It's because of this I will not return.",,,

Service was pretty nice
Food was not good this time. The garlic was so burnt on the carbonara I couldn't eat it. Pancetta seemed a bit old too. The owner asked if I wanted it remade which is cool, but I didn't feel like having anymore of that rich dish again. We got sick to our stomachs after eating the margarita pizza. All night. On New Year's Eve. It just seemed like the ingredients were cheap or stale. Garlic bread was cheap. For $2 a serving tho what can I expect.

I came in at 1:30pm on a weekday and there was noone in the restaurant and the owners were sitting at one of the tables, and planning out the cooking classes for later in the day.
The margherita pizza was really meh. The cheese to crust ratio was off, there was simply too much. Additionally, there was a fair bit of italian seasoning in the crust/under the cheese that threw me off, but overall it contributed to the dish. But this did turn out way too oily, probably due to the excessive amount of cheese. The cheese ended up flowing between each slice of the pizza where it was cut, if that paints a picture.
I'd come back and try the pasta dishes one day, but i'll definitely be avoiding the pizza in the future. I recommend coming here at least once to check it out! It has a warm family owned welcoming vibe.",,,

International District, Seattle, WA","DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE RUDE AND SHITTY SERVICE
We were craving for some pasta and saw that this was the closest one at walking distance in pioneer square. I would give this place a 0 if I could.
We were seated by an older woman who looked like might own the place given by her terrible and careless attitude. As you enter, there is no signage or check in booth, so you are left wondering how far deep you have to go into the restaurant to ask for help. We walk in a few steps and the owner gets up from a dining table similar to one that someone would keep at home - and comes up to us and ask us to be seated. The dining table was a mess, it looked like her office. There was a laptop, a couple of Starbucks cups and a stack of paperwork. We were sat right next to her table. And opposite from her - what seemed like her home office desk - was a mini bar. LOL - it was basically a buffet with a bunch of bottles of alcohol sitting there.
We sat down and were asked right away if we wanted anything to drink besides water. We asked for a drink menu and the owner said that she didn't have one ... we asked her to give us a few minutes. And when she came back we were still confused so we ended up not ordering a drink.
Our water glasses were FILTHY! We even told her that we would like a new glass, she kept telling us that "" they're not dirty, we just stack them on top of each other "" ok - the glass was literally cracked on the inside, it's like when you scrape a piece of glass against something and there is some debris coming off from it .. we then told her "" ok, can we still get a replacement glass "" she just made her way out - this was after taking our order. Her attitude was terrible that we ended up getting up and walking out of there!
What really irritated me was that she didn't care that we asked for a new glass to drink out of - or had a drink menu for us to choose from , and with her filthy attitude - they have the audacity to charge a 20% gratuity! No ma'am , I used to be a server and I got tipped for my service. And this place did not deserve a single dime.
I will not be returning. We didn't even get a chance to try the food, but the way you treat your customers is what matters most! I am surprised that they haven't gone out of business yet - it's just a waste of space in pioneer square.",,,

New York, NY","This one is a bit of a head scratcher. The ratings on Yelp are very high, but our actual experience was more in the 2 to 2.5 star range.
Came here on a Saturday night and it was fairly busy but had a few empty tables. Once we were acknowledged by someone, they said we'd have a table in a few minutes and we did. The guy who took our order was nice and we made it simple...two salads and three spaghetti and meatballs (Polpette). Watching the other tables, it seemed like each one had a wrong order delivered. The table right next two us asked for the check before they got their food because they'd been waiting so long and then when the food came, it was wrong (although the correct food came out quickly).
Our spaghetti and meatballs came out quickly. Unfortunately, we hadn't received any salads so we asked about those. The guy who delivered the food asked what we had ordered and he went to check. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was decent, though a bit bland. I'll be honest that I didn't care for the meatballs as they were filled with raisins and pine nuts. Just not a fan of that texture so I just ate the pasta.
A server comes back to check on us and we ask about the salads again. Then we ask if we can have some garlic bread. We did receive some garlic bread (which was not the style I like, very toasted with lots of garlic and butter...this was barely heated with just a bit of garlic) but still no salad. At that point, the server asks if we still want the salads since we are almost finished the meal and we just said we wanted one of them. We finally got that and it was okay.
The bill came quickly and we paid and left. It was just an odd place. There were two ""manager"" types (an older man and woman) who seemed to be fussing around at the ""desk"" by the front door but the servers were really hustling. Just seemed nobody was communicating with one another. As I didn't care for the style of food that was served, I would not return.

San Diego, CA","There is a hand written note inside the menu that says: ""20% service charge has been added""
I thought the wording and grammar means (present perfect) it is in the price already.
I was surprised to see that our bill came to $90 and it was an incredibly bad meal. Pizza swimming in grease, terrible lasagna and a suspiciously light tasting glass of red wine and one tiny appetizer.
I asked about why the note didn't say: ""... will be added"".
The owner was rude and said there is nothing wrong with the wording, and no one had ever mentioned it!! Well, then he never read his yelp reviews because 1 out of 3 reviews do mention it - as a surprise and as a disappointment.
1 star is a lot when (did I mention the service was rude and the water was lukewarm tap water? - which is kind of an oxymoron)
- the food is horrible

- the portions are small

-Lasagna was also just ok. Not that many layers and average sauce. Would try something different next time.
-Spicy meat spaghetti was worth getting! Just enough heat to wake u up. Fair portion size and fresh pasta.
-creamy fettuccine was my favorite. Creamy light sauce and of course fresh pasta and if u don't like mushrooms that's ok cuz u can't taste them.
-Lemon cake wasnt super light and fluffy or heavy and dense. It was a great medium. The breading base was great as well, brought it all together.
-Bread pudding you should get. If you like raisens and a sweeter bread pudding this is for you. Good texture with putter bread a little harder and more crispy.
-Mozzarella and meat is a nothing special appetizer . Small and oily cheese.

I got the pasta carbonara, and it had fettuccine noodles instead of the regular spaghetti noodles, which I would have preferred. Topped with a copious amount of the Parmesan cheese they left at the table, it was pretty good.

After he gave each of the groups water, he got all of us to quiet down and started presenting the specials to all of us at the same time. They had just a ton of specials though so I could see why he didn't want to repeat himself.
Other than the specials announcement, it started to get a little warm with the sun coming in through the West facing window. If you're here in the summer, maybe ask for a seat away from the window.
Also, the coconut sorbet was served in a coconut shell. It seemed very similar to the specialty brand of ice cream sold in Costco and similar grocery stores. It was just kind of odd.

We've been pleased with everything we've tried; the burrata was especially noteworthy, and I've not had tiramisu the proper combo of boozy and earthy chocolate (rather than sickly sweet chocolate) outside of Italy proper.
A recurrent theme in the negative reviews for this place (and at least one other decent restaurant in the area) is about the bread. Here's the deal: Italian bread is not like American bread. It is there to absorb the incredible amount of sauce and good olive oil in your dish; the focus is not on the flavor of the bread itself. No, it's not modern artisanal bread. It's not trying to be, and it doesn't need to be. Don't dig it? Fine. But don't claim you want authentic and then bash it when it actually arrives!",,,

Seattle, WA","Have I mentioned that my Italian side is almost impossible to please when it comes to Italian cuisine? But coming to Salvatore's was a nice change. I finally found a good Italian restaurant that makes solid Italian food that left me completely satisfied.
We ordered several appetizers including two antipasto, arugula salad and a special that was a mozzarella with mascarpone cheese and prosciutto.
The antipasto came with some cheese, salami, mortadella and capicola as well as some Giardiniera salad. I liked that they used hard salami and not the soft variety. The cheese was good but it could have used a few more slices. The capicola was nice and spicy as I like it. The gardenia salad had a mix of carrots, cauliflower, peperoncini peppers, celery and red bell peppers which was in the middle of the plate.
The mozzarella and mascarpone cheese appetizer was simply amazing. The mix of mozzarella to mascarpone was perfect. It was served with four large pieces of prosciutto and sitting on olive oil sprinkled with basil on top. Since there were seven of us we split the prosciutto in half so more people could enjoy it. This was my favorite appetizer by far. This went great with their bread.
The arugula salad had an olive oil and lemon flavor with some fresh cheese on top. It cane with several different types of tomatoes as well. There was a very large amount of salad which was good for our big party.
We ordered the ravioli alla Bolognese, the pasta al forno, spaghetti aglio olio & acciughe, penne ala puttanesca, penne Bolognese and two orders of the veal special. I had a taste of all of the dishes and really thought the ravioli alla Bolgnese, the veal special and the penne ala puttanesca were the best. I thought the penne Bolgnese and the pasta ala forno were both solid dishes but the spaghetti aglio olio & acciughe was way too salty and fishy. I could only eat one fork of it. But everything else was great so I'm still giving this place five stars. My little nephew ate the whole thing and loved it!
The ravioli alla Bolognese was great. The ravioli were cooked perfectly and none of my ravioli were broken. The cheese filling was not watery and there was just the right amount of sauce. It may not look like a lot of food but it was filling. The veal dinner special was served with a side of ziti. The veal was definitely the best thing on the menu! The flavors were balanced perfectly with the use of spices and a bit of wine. The cooked spinach with it also added to the overall appeal of this dish.
The pasta al forno was the lasagne. It was a nice sized serving and it was great to see that it was not watery when brought to the table. The balance of mozzarella and ricotta was spot on. Both the penne alla puttanesca and the pene Bolognese had al dente pasta. The puttanesca had a hint of anchovy in the read sauce. If you like anchovies get this. The one dish I did not like was the spaghetti aglio olio & acciughe. I had one taste of it and felt it was way too fishy with an anchovy overload! None of the adults liked it but my young nephew ate all of it.
For dessert we had the tiramisu which was huge! It tasted wonderful and was very fresh! The chocolate cake with ice cream had very moist cake and it was also a nice size piece of cake. The puff pastry dessert had a nice amount of whipped cream and ice cream. It was very filling!
We also had two bottles of Arcangelo Salice Salentino which was good as was the Peroni of course. We also had espresso and black coffee.
Everything except for one dish was great. My Italian side left very satisfied! If you give this place a try tell them Jeff's Nonna sent you!",,,

Since it was Mardi Gras, the waitress explained how the owners roots were from Louisiana, and they created a special menu that was almost like creole fusion.
We ordered two gnocchi dishes: GNOCCHI VERDI ALLA NORCINA ($20) and the GNOCCHI AL POMODORO ($19).
The food itself was good, it wasn't outstanding to me. Do not get me wrong, the rich truffle sauce was amazing but I probably wouldn't return.
The service was good, they always filled up my water which was really great. The hostess was really nice as well!",,,

Seattle, WA","With SO many Italian restaurants on Capitol Hill alone, let alone in Seattle, one has to stand out. Osteria la Spiga stands out for its spacious and well-decorated interior. This is a place to take your mom. It's also a place for a big group of friends. And it's easy to eat out by one's self at the bar or in the back room, which is quieter. It accommodates big and small groups of any age.
Cocktails are interesting and can be customized. I like when a server offers to tweak a drink just for you.
There's a lengthy list of appetizers, which do indeed look appetizing. The Gnocco Frito is a great ""bread"" choice: big pillowy dough puffed up.
Unfortunately for me, I ordered the Pasticcio as my vegetarian entree. Although it's listed under Secondi, the main course, it was surprisingly tiny. I mean, two thin slices of eggplant topped with red sauce. That's it??! Come on chefs, even vegetarians have appetites! Either make it more substantial or put it under appetizers. Although at $18, it'd be a pricey appetizer.",,,

They have a really great wine list with a bunch of Italian wines. I am not that familiar with them, but the bottle I had was great. Service was a little slow because they were busy, but good.
The menu is very Italian also. I started with the Formaggi Misti cheese plate. The cheeses were absolutely wonderful and it was a great mix. I particularly loved the hard cheese--but I would have been tempted to order it twice in a night.
For my main course I had the Tortelli Del Capo--which were tortelli stuffed with ricotta and raisins. This was superb, the pasta and cheese tasted super fresh and the rosemary butter source was to die for, just fantastic.",,,

I had the Lasagne Verdi (spinach lasagna noodles layered with ragu bolognese, b茅chamel and parmigiano reggiano). It was honestly heavenly. At $19, it was just a little on the pricey side but definitely worth it. Unfortunately this place doesn't do complimentary bread, but you can buy some for only $3.

I see the current menu on their website has changed from the past 3 times I've been there, one of the reasons I haven't been back in a while is because of the lack of variation in the menu.

Daly City, CA","Going off of yelp and just the photos I came in for dinner while I was visiting Seattle for the first time to try out the food that looked so good through photos. I was able to make a reservation for a Friday night super easily which was nice! We were sat right when we came in and our server came to ask for drinks but we weren't ready. When we were ready I had a question about the spritz, the server then said he was going to bring me a sample of the liquor I asked for and then my boyfriend asked for a beer but then the server said they were out of stock. When he brought the drinks back I ended up with an already made spritz, and no sample. I tried it out and ended up not liking it so I eventually told the server I wanted to get something else and he took the spritz off the bill, which was much appreciated.
Our appetizers were wonderful with great flavor, but kind of odd presentation with the paper on the board under the prosciutto. We ordered the tortellini di agnello and the gnochetti della fiera and were super excited to get them until they arrived poorly plated and the tortellini was missing multiple fillings inside the pasta itself. The desert was great!!!
Overall I think the restaurant had great potential, but I think it needs to work on the details more so to get the full five stars.",,,

Seattle, WA","I'd walked by Osteria la Spiga on plenty of occasions without ever stopping by. I finally had the chance to dine here recently. Turns out that the restaurant is significantly larger than you'd expect from the outside--once you enter, you're greeted by a rather expansive, high-roofed space that feels simultaneously classy and rustic.
The restaurant was able to accommodate our large group with an advance reservation. They recommended pre-ordering appetizers, so that's what we did (there was a moment of confusion among some folks when food that certainly didn't look complimentary began being placed on the table shortly after we arrived, heh). Both the wine and cocktail lists are solid. I highly recommend the Rhonda if you like negronis--made with Piedmontese gin and Carpano Antica, it was a delicious rendition of one of my favorite cocktails.
I ordered the Tortelli al Porcini as my entree, and really enjoyed it. I'm a sucker for mushrooms, and this dish was all about the mushrooms (including truffle butter!). Portion sizes were solid--a couple of people in the group ended up needing boxes because they couldn't finish (granted, we did order a healthy pile of appetizers). Service was pleasant without being overbearing, and they didn't rush us out as soon as we were done eating--it's nice to be able to linger without cutting off the conversation, especially when the restaurant clearly isn't too busy.
Overall, pretty solid meal! It's a quieter, more traditional Italian food experience than nearby Tavolata. The dishes specifically focus on Northern Italian cuisine, which is something I enjoyed. This is definitely a popular date spot based on other tables that were around us.",,,

I did not even know a new Italian restaurant had opened up as I honestly avoid Rainier Avenue for a number of reasons. But recently I wanted to go someplace new and didn't want to drive to Seattle so when I saw that a highly rated restaurant existed in Renton that I hadn't been to I wanted to check it out.
My friend and I were instantly and warmly greeted upon entering and I was captivated with the remodel making an old Pizza Hut restaurant into something cozy and delightful. Throughout the evening we were helped by multiple people who all were warm and gracious and called me ""Bella"" which just added to the charm.
The dining experience delightful and the food and drink matched up. The wine pours were generous and the food was amazing. We both ordered the special of the night which was this delightful pasta with spicy sausage and shrimp. It was heavenly.
My only regret was that I didn't find this restaurant in my 20's when I had the metabolism to burn off carb heavy meals. I enjoyed the whole experience and would highly recommend people to visit there. It is a cute family owned restaurant and it is obvious how much of their energy and effort went into it.",,,

The food was not bad, but not worth being over $20. I ordered a carbonara that tasted more like noodles in Alfredo sauce. This was alright and a little softer than I would've liked. However the pesto butter for the bread was delicious!
All and all, this place is nice for the area, but the price and the food are not my style. For the price range, I'd rather go to Il Terrazzo Carmine or Tutta Bella in Seattle.",,,

Tacoma, WA","It was time for a dinner date with my friend, and we usually need plenty of time to decide on where to eat. But this time, she already had this place in mind, having heard about how good this place was from her friend, so that definitely saved us the difficulty of choosing a restaurant.
She got here first and already started on the complimentary bread with the tasty flavored butter. We both started off with a glass of pinot grigio ($9 each) the Calamari Fritti ($16). The fries calamari was good with the cilantro aioli, but wasn't the greatest. My friend ordered the Linguine di Mare and I ordered the Penne con Pollo Diavola. I really enjoyed my pasta and the flavor of its garlic red pepper sauce. My friend seemed to enjoy her seafood pasta as well, since she finished it, and she doesn't finish all her food too often. We decided to take a look at the dessert menu, which the waiter then brought over a big platter displaying about eight different desserts. My friend and I decided on the Mixed Berry Torta, which was pretty good, not too heavy and not too sweet.
The service was excellent. All the staff members were very friendly, and they all made sure we were good.",,,

WA, WA","We've been here twice now, and we like it.
Two dishes stand out for us: the Calamari Fritti, and the Tiramisu. My MIL got the Gamberoni Fiorentine which she really liked except that the spinach needed to be salted both times we were there. (They don't put salt on the table, so we had to ask for it to be brought, which is slightly embarrassing.) Hubs and I really love that fried calamari! We gobble it up like it's our last meal!
MIL also got the Chicken Picatta both times we were there, and she really loves it. Hubs did too. I got the Chicken Marsala on our first visit, and it was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. But in fairness to the restaurant, I need to explain. Many years ago, I tasted Chicken Marsala for the first time, and I fell in love with it. But I have never had one since then that tasted like that first one; nothing satisfies me. I'll optimistically order it on occasion, in the hope that I will love, it, but so far... no luck.
My recent main course was Alfredo with chicken. It was good, but the chicken pieces needed salt. The sauce didn't need salt, but the chicken did. (As I recall, the Marsala I ordered on my first visit also needed salt.) Hubby's recent main dish was Bolognese, which is often a favorite of his, but he said it was just okay.
On our first visit, we each got a dessert: the cannoli (no one really liked it very much), the raspberry-lemon tart (again, not that great), and the tiramisu (fantastic!). As far as we're concerned, the only dessert to get here is the excellent Tiramisu -- it's the best ever!
Both times we were there, we got seated at the same table, and had the same waiter. My MIL can be quite picky about her food preferences, and he was very accommodating. We appreciate that.",,,

I decided to try Sansonina after several people on the I Love Renton! Facebook page recommended it. I placed a reservation on OpenTable and gave it a whirl.
The owners did a really great job of transforming this location (formerly Pizza Hut) into a very nice restaurant with plenty of space.
Okay, okay - let's get straight to the important stuff... THE FOOD.
APPETIZER & SALAD:
Gamberoni Fiorentini: 5 STARS. (Huge prawns, amazing flavor, must try if you love garlic. YUM)
Caesar Salad: 4 STARS (Not very big for $9, but the dressing is good.)
ENTREES
-Ravioli con Salsiccia
Saut茅ed bell peppers and red onions, spicy sausage, cilantro red sauce - 5 STARS
-Seafood Cioppino - 5 STARS (LOADED with seafood and had a nice spice to it. He loved it.)
-Ravioli con Salsiccia - 5 STARS (HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
A large portion, the cilantro red sauce was very unique and delicious,
the sausage was top-notch...oh and the ravioli! So good.)

My friend treated me to this restaurant for my birthday & I had a great time catching up while enjoying beautifully presented food in a nice atmosphere. To my surprise, Sansaonina took over the old Pizza Hut & converted it to this new restaurant. I grew up around this area & just thought it was cool when my gps took me here because it's now probably one of the nicest restaurant located in this neighborhood besides Melrose Grill.
This is one of those places that you come for a special celebration/occasion because they have an extensive wine list, but this is good if you're simply just craving Italian food on a random Tuesday evening also. The space is small & intimate, easy to get your server's attention. My rule of thumb is just if I can't make out easily what the menu is saying with the fancy language, it's probably legit Italian food. Parking is really easy, plenty of space in the back if the front gets full.

Redmond, WA","I wanted so badly for this place to be good. An upscale Italian restaurant would nicely flesh out the portfolio of Renton dining options. Unfortunately, despite a charming atmosphere, the food is just bad. Overpriced and bad.
My first visit I got the veal marsala and my companion got the chicken piccata. The veal was overly thick, unevenly cooked, and came in a watery, flavorless Marsala sauce. It tasted like cafeteria Salisbury steak. The chicken was somewhat better in so much as it tasted like chicken, but it was overcooked and tough. The Caesar salad was passable but certainly nothing to write home about.
I will give them credit for having a good tiramisu. Whatever bakery they partnered with is solid. Still, it was not enough to bring redemption to this establishment. Upon receiving the bill (over $100 for this debacle) I was filled with quiet rage.
Despite all of this, I foolishly returned to give them a second try. Nope. They sucked again.",,,

The staff is so kind. It was fun to talk to Bruno the owner. And his apprentice Marcus was awesome! Bruno gave me a pistachio macaroon with my beer! It was so freaking delicious. There was still a little sweetness but nice and light.
I didn't get any food because had just eaten. But the beer and macaroon was yum! I really love their remodel as well. It puts the whole place together. Also they have a new state of the art pizza oven. It can cook pizza in like 12 seconds. Something crazy like that. Of course I'm exaggerating. Definitely go try out it!",,,

Los Angeles, CA","Really interesting concept of Pizza and Pasta bar where you can get quick cooked meal for price of the restaurant food. We payed $45 for lunch meal (ouchhhh) My husband took chicken pesto penne pasta and I took lobster ravioli. His pasta was OK but chicken was extra $3 and it tasted like warmed leftover chicken.I didn't had high expectations for lobster ravioli at this place but since its my fav dish I decided to try. Pasta dough was horrible, it was undercooked and lobster meat inside tasted like this pasta that you buy at the supermarket. I am big fan of Italian food and I traveled a lot across the Italy and I am sorry I cant call it Pasta. For a counter service restaurant, I think the prices are way too high. Parmesan cheese containers in every table, and they were all empty (PS its not a real parmesan cheese). This counter service restaurant its overpriced.
Dear Owner,
Thank you for your advice but I don't need to be pointed out where I may or may not eat. I am free to eat anywhere I want or say HOW I felt about my experience. My review was honest and many people wrote the same thing- its overpriced, empty cheese containers, bad service, tasteless pasta. I didn't said anything about bad service but after your response I don't think you can take honest critics to improve your business. Seems I am not only one who got a rude response from the owner (you tell people they are welcome not to come back/eat somewhere else). Many people who were honest that they didn't like something got an unpleasant message from You. My 3 stars were not a bad review but room to improve because my husbands pasta tasted OK but mine was completely undercooked. I don't want to talk about heritage and compare who knows the best. My point was that I (personally) can't call it pasta and it's my opinion. Unfortunately some people can't take the constructive criticism.",,,

Service: The man at the counter kept on messing up our order even though we only ordered 4 slices. First he claimed that my friend only ordered one and wanted to charge her again for a second slice even though she clearly already paid over $14 for two slices. Then he kept on forgetting who ordered what even though half their pizza options were unavailable and we simply ordered 2 cheese slices and 2 meat lover slices. Though we clarified with him 3 times, he STILL tried to give me a cheese slice though I ordered meat lovers.
Price: $6 for cheese, $7 for anything else, +$0.50 for using card if your order is under $10 -- with tax my single slice was over $8, which is enough to get an entire pizza at MOD!
Food: Taste was mediocre at best and now my friend and I feel very unwell. I feel very queasy and dizzy. I will never come here again -- definitely do NOT recommend!",,,

My slice of pepperoni pizza took about 15 minutes to come out on a Saturday afternoon, and when it arrived I was shocked at how small and meager it appeared (good size for a my five-year-old god son). The flavor was decent but overall nothing special. They also charge 50 cents for purchases under $10 so this child-sized slice of mediocre pizza came out to just over $7. I would not return.

Sparkling water is something this place has. They even had blue power aide too. The pizza choices were pretty simple. This is the good news.
This place did not customize orders and the woman/cashier was not the friendliest of people I met. She greeted us, but could not seem to keep her attention on her guest who were ordering food.
The pizza was decent, but not the best pizza I have tasted. I did not see any plastic utensils and trying to get the woman's attention again to ask did not seem appealing. The Male manager pretty much had the same attitude as the woman.

But their sauce was delicious and I had no problem finishing the whole plate of pasta. They also sprinkle parmesan cheese on top which adds a nice finish to the pasta.

La Habra, CA","Came here since the entire time I was in Seattle, I was craving Spaghetti. First thing I noticed was this place was empty. There was a woman, man and young man working. Next thing I noticed was their prices.... $18 for spaghetti at a hole in the wall. WTH?!?! But I really wanted it so I ordered it. They had a special that day and it was $15 for it so I saved $3 bucks. My mom was with me but wasn't planning on ordering since we all were getting different places she wanted to nibble on everything. The lady (who I believe was also an owner) charged me a $3 split fee?!?! WTH. I wasn't splitting it and I wasn't eating in either. My mom kinda handled that situation and the lady took off the $3 but was very rude and not personable at all. After my spaghetti and 2 drinks it came out to damn near $30. $8 for two 16oz soda? Geez. While the young man was cooking my food I asked for it to go Incase they didn't realize. But I noticed on the menu that they charge you for boxes! What in the world. Never have I ever been to a restaurant or take out place where you get charged for a box. That's just greedy and unnecessary. The young man was very nice and so was the man who I believe is also an owner. But that lady needs to be thrown in the back where no one can talk to her until she learns how to be polite. The spaghetti however was very delicious and it's probably the only reason for the star. Despite the tiny portion for the price, It had great flavor & tasted authentic. The salad was gross and the garlic bread was decent. Definitely not worth $18.

While waiting in that line, I noticed a small Italian joint in the back and it intrigued me. While the rest of my family waited in line , I checked out their menu and saw a women who had the most divine looking meatball mountain on her plate. I told my husband to only get two bowls of chowder for our family of four and I popped over and bought us two meatball subs for our impromptu hodge podge lunch.
Best decision ever!!! The chowder was delicious as was expected, but the meatball subs are what we are still salivating over and remembering two weeks later. They aren't your typical subs, they are more like two huge pieces of perfectly seasoned garlic toast with a mountain of delicious saucy meatballs on top.

Los Angeles, CA","Got a large 23"" pizza, half margherita, half pepperoni/sausage/onion/olives/green peppers/mushrooms. Because the margherita is considered a 3 topping pie, they let me add the first 3 toppings on the other half free of charge, and charged $1.88 ish per topping ($3.75 per 2 toppings) for the other 3 toppings - 1/2 price per topping since they were only going on 1/2 the pie. This is a fair pricing scheme for toppings - I like.
They forgot my mushrooms.
Pizza was tasty. NOT burnt black on the bottom like some in the reviews. Crust was just perfectly chewy, perfect amount of sauce, and toppings were generous. This place makes thin crust NY style pizza. This means it will cool down faster. So don't expect pipin' hot pizza if u get it to go/delivered.
Only con for me was that they were not using the smaller pepperonis that curl up like the ones in the pictures from ~3 years ago. IMO those small, thicker cut pepperonis are almost always better than the regular ones that they now use (same ones as pretty much all other pizza chains like Dominos, Papa Johns, Costco, etc).
Parking isn't great. If you are driving alone for a pick up order, prepare to find parking a block or so down and walk back and forth.

At first, this place seemed an unlikely contender, as the options seemed really limited and we were unsure of how good the pizza would be. However, after much deliberating, we decided to go with Italian Family Pizza and we did not regret it!
We ordered a medium cheese pizza with bell pepper, mushroom, and garlic topping over the phone, and it was ready to pick up in 20 minutes. Soon as we walked in, they had our pizza out and ready, freshly made. The pizza tasted great -- the garlic steeped into the cheese well and the veggies used were freshly baked into the pizza.

The crust is so good I would literally eat it on its own as a plain baked flatbread. Soft, billowy, pulls apart like the gossamer feathers of angel wings! Flavors subtle and fresh. With toppings, the pizza has an excellent chew.
Tomato sauce is zesty and bright. Toppings are plentiful and perfectly balanced. They do add large lumps fresh ricotta to some of their pies. I'm not a huge fan usually but I loved it; you can break off the end crust and dip it in ricotta which was a fun way to devour a slice.

The interior is quite large, and it gave off a blend of vibes - authentic pizzeria & chain restaurant in the making. The server gave off a quick & snappy but warm feeling, but it made me feel like it was authentic experience.
The pies were exactly as i expected, they were huge, and I did notice that there was a pizza oven that got hot enough to replicate the semi-burned flavors you'd get on a pizza, but personally i'd recommend to avoid going with getting the HUGE pizza, get multiple smaller ones. The dough was a bit thicker (most probably due to the size of the pie), and the toppings/sauces were very scarce. I'm not one to desire heavily saucy pizzas, but there could definitely been more to give the right balance. I was almost tempted to ask for an extra serving of tomato sauce to pair with my pizza.
Even though the pie was slightly lacking, it was still average/above average, and the novelty of a huge pie can be great for big parties! I'd recommend coming here to try it at least once, I had a pleasant experience, and I'd come back to try their smaller pies!",,,

Seattle, WA","Absolutely Delicious! This is the Deal!
Italian Family Pizza is East coast style with thin crust, fresh ingredients, and incredible red sauce.
-The pizza:
After coming here a few times, there really is no way you can go wrong. Whether just ordering a small for 1 or 2 people, or ordering the very large 23"" pizza, any of the options will not disappoint you.
Their sauce and their crust really pair well with any of the vegetable or meat toppings. Personal favorite is the new yorker.
If you want to try something different, their white pie is sauceless, but comes with 3 different cheeses and you can always add toppings to it as well.
-Other menu items:
They have one salad, but it is all you need. It comes with a tangy red pepper dressing, and the salad comes fully loaded with olives, cheese, and pepperoncinis.
The cannolis are made every day and are too good to come from a pizza place.
They also offer pastas, stromboli, and calzones. I have yet to try any of these because the pizzas from this place keep me coming back.
-Service:
The customer service here is always friendly and your food comes out quickly. They will answer your questions if you have any, and are happy to make recommendations.
-Price:
For being in downtown Seattle, (well, first hill), these prices are really good. Especially if you go big and get the large pizza, you will get more than pizza to feed 4-5 people for between $30-$40 which is a great deal especially when you consider the quality!
Note: they do not deliver, but they do carry out, and there are third parties that can deliver if you so wish. However, it is worth going your first time, sitting down at the red-white checkered tables surrounded by brick for the full experience!

Italian Family Pizza doesn't serve slices, but that just means you can go with a friend & split 2 things! The small pizza is plenty for 2 to share, and the salad is good. Definitely not a boring plate of greens. My friend very wisely asked for dressing on the side, and that was a pro move. The dressing is not your typical oil & vinegar. It's slightly spicy and I liked it, but in small amounts, which is why you definitely want it on the side, and drizzle it with a light hand. The pizza is good, and they definitely didn't skimp on the pepperoni (see pic). The only thing I may ask is for the pizza to be a little more well-done in the middle, because it's not sturdy enough to be picked up on its own.

The sauce was notably fresh (not canned), the cheese to sauce ratio was spot on, and the dough was crispy on the bottom and soft but not soggy on top (i.e. not overdone). The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt the overall value wasn't 100% there. My bill was $20 (inc. tip). That's a bit steep for a single serving pizza. The large is $40!

The menu is pretty limited. They have a huge pizza and a 12 inch (basically individual) pizza. We ordered a huge pizza with 1/2 cheese and 1/2 pepperoni & mushroom. Myself and one of the kids wanted the rigatoni, however, they ran out. What Italian restaurant runs out of pasta? I don't eat cheese so I ordered the small pizza with mushrooms, sauce and garlic.
We also ordered the salad. It has 1 heart of artichoke, a head of lettuce, chopped roasted red pepper, pepperocini peppers and kalamata olives. It was very fresh but only had about 2 tablespoons of dressing provided. After delivering the food our server disappeared, so we lived with the limited dressing.
The large pizza looked like it was made from different dough. Everyone liked it. Mine was soggy in the middle so I ate the crust and some of the mushrooms. They were freshly cut.

A good portion of their pasta dishes run almost $25 which makes it a place that I cannot go to often. However, when I do go, I will most certainly be happy with what I order.",,,

Would highly recommend the Pasta Brodo soup, the beef/veal polpette, Fettuccine Ciociara (sub for chicken), Linguini Capagnola, and the Gina Maria. Their wines are very affordable but they also have a decent liquor selection if you're craving a martini or Cosmo (when the world gets back to normal-ish). Have really enjoyed their to-go options and portion sizes and look forward to continuing to support this business.",,,

Rarely is there a wait but it's always comfortably busy. I came last time to celebrate getting a new job and so I treated myself with the don giovanni rissoto. This has lobster, scallops and prawns drizzled in white truffle oil. I absolutely love this dish and it's a nice juxtaposition to more saucy dishes. The saucy dish we got this time was the lobster ravioli. It wasn't on the menu but I still asked and to my joy, they had it. The cream
Based sauce will give you a case of the involuntary MMMs! The starter we always get is the calamari in red sauce. They come not breaded and perfectly saut茅ed. It has a nice kick to it as well. Dunking the table bread they give to you is the move. It is also advised to drink wine the whole time to keep it real italian.",,,

Seattle, WA","TLDR: wordy menu. More pasta than meat.
When was the last time you've read a novel? The menu is a mini novel. There is so much text! I appreciate the descriptions of items but a few pictures to alleviate the eyes would be nice. It also takes a while to read everything before you order because there's just so much to read. Not being Italian doesn't help since the names of each dish are Italian so you are forced to read the description. Maybe I'm just lazy but really I'm just hungry.
Very dimly lit so picture quality will be poor but it's a good romantic setting. Check out those giant frames with the wine bottles!
Service: wait to be seated, table service, order at the table, your check will be brought to you.
Complimentary bread and oil: bread is served cold and is in large slices. I like the chewiness of the bread but it's otherwise tasteless without the oil. Generous portion of oil with LOTS of garlic.
Rigatoni Amatriciana: rigatoni is great but there isn't very much pancetta--it felt like just pasta and sauce really. The meat to pasta ratio wasn't well balanced in this dish. Loads of sliced onion and tomato sauce though. A little too much onion in my opinion but the sauce is good.",,,

Kirkland, WA","As an east-coast Italian, I hold Italian food to a very high standard! Tropea does a good job with their pastas - I've had the linguine vongole and gnocchi pomodoro and was satisfied with both meals. The portion sizes are a little small compared to the price, but you will not leave still hungry. The table bread is very mediocre - they should think about baking their own bread or at least serving it warm to customers! The olive oil dipping cup is full of spices and garlic which helps offset the blandness of the bread. Not the best Italian food I've had on the Eastside, but certainly not the worst.",,,

Over priced. Had the pollo limone - sauce was soupy and literally tasted like the bile you barf up at the end of a good puking session. 26 for the plate and barely any pasta on the plate - maybe $3 of product on the plate. Service was very slow with only half the tables full inside. Inside was very hot as well - no AC and actually outside felt colder when I left.
Also if the place has to force you to buy $8 of product you're in trouble. I have never seen a ""minimum"" purchase on any Italian restaurant menu.

Great, friendly service, options to sit inside or outside and authentic, southern Italian cuisine make this our fave Italian restaurant on the Eastside. The patio area is small, with approximately 5 tables, but is a comfortable little Oasis and nicely shielded from the parking area with shrubbery.
So far we have tried the caprese (with burrata, if available), calamari impanantate, lasagna, ravioli Mari Monte, a risotto special with seafood and tiramisu. Would highly recommend all. Tiramisu was the best I have had, including in Italy. The calamari was lightly breaded and fried and not too greasy. We have twice ordered it with the spicy tomato sauce included with the calamari diavola and would highly recommend. I often dream about the amazing flavor and creaminess of the ravioli Mari Monte and it is probably my favorite dish.
While the prices may be a touch high, we found the portions to be massive and would need to pack up at least half our entree to go.

The dessert was the least favorite part so I'll probably skip that next time but all in all this is a great spot!

For a $30 CHICKEN dish, I was expecting to be mind blown but I could taste no sign of truffle. It was either masked with the pounds of butter or none was actually in there. The pasta was bland as well because it comes with the same sauce as the chicken ($5 up charge to change the sauce). Service was good but I don't think we will be returning.",,,

See Naples and die - or just trot over to Rainier Beach and have an authentic southern Italian pie!
According to their website, Pulcinella is brought to you by the same folks who own and operate Vince's. And, it has been ""certified Neapolitan"" by the Verace Pizza Napolitana Association since 2009.
The pizzeria is in a rustic building with high ceilings and expansive windows. The restaurant has a cozy feeI with table and bar seating, as well as a pizza counter where I grabbed a front row seat.stopped in on a rainy Wednesday night and was greeted by a friendly and helpful staff.
At the recommendation of Leo, the pizza maker, I decided on the Italian sausage and bell peppers appetizer ($10), which is given a brief roasting in the pizza oven and served in the cast iron skillet. Tasty, and the red sauce was hearty and flavorful.
Completing my order was the Giovanni pie - roasted pepper & pesto sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, onion, crimini mushrooms, fresh tomatoes.
My server explained they would wait to put in the pizza order, because it bakes in just 90 seconds - and they weren't kidding. In fact, Leo, pointed out that part of their certification is a requirement to bake their pies to the 90 second mark - and - not a second more!

They make each pizza per order and they use fresh ingredients. The staff is nice and they have a lot of options to choose from. It has a very rustic pizza parlor feel and the dark wood interior and accents give it a real Italian vibe.
I got the Pozzuoli and when I tell you I inhaled this pizza I'm not lying. I don't even think it made it to the 5 minute mark. The crust was the perfect and there was not too much sauce on the pizza. The pepperoni was fresh and so were the mushrooms. It had the perfect bite and the pizza crust was good too. I have nothing negative to say about this place.

Best thing about the food was 1) the pizza dough/crust 2) pepperoni, it's like seasoned or something but super good! We also tried the lasagna which was good with the ground meat being the highlight. I do still enjoy the pizza more though so I'd return for more of that. The weird thing to me was the middle of the pizza was super soggy.

Seattle, WA","After reading several great reviews from people that have traveled to Italy or are Italian, I told my bf that we had to try this restaurant.
We went on Friday night and got there about 7:30 pm. The restaurant was packed. The only available seating was at the bar, which I thought was perfect. It sat us in front of the kitchen and it was the best view in the house.
The staff was very friendly and was attentive to us. We started with the Caesar salad, meatballs with marinara sauce and foccacia bread. Everything was great. We could have just been happy with ordering just that and dessert. But we also had to try the pizzas.
The timing of when our pizza came out to us was perfect. After we finished our appetizers, we didn't wait too long for it to arrive. It gave us enough time to digest our food. We ordered the Margherita and Diavola. The pizzas look amazing. I loved the taste, ingredients and the crust. I'm not a big fan of Margherita pizza, but this one was great tasting and I liked it very much. I love the spicy olive oil and the pepperoni in the Diavola pizza. The owner came to talk to us after our meal. We told him it was our first time and everything was great.
For dessert, we got the mocha decadence cake. It was amazing! Yuuuuuummmm.

You know it's authentic when you need a knife and a fork to eat it because the crust is so perfectly thin!

Okay, now that I have your attention, I'll take it down a notch, although, I really shouldn't because they deserve as much;)
My husband lived in Italy for a few years while serving in the Navy and really fell in love with the food and the culture there. So while I was casually surfing Yelp I came upon this place, and the reviews that kept referring to its Italian authenticity. I knew I had to bring him here.
Like many others stated before, the place is on the small side. And parking can be a little rough. We got there at 7pm on a Friday night and it was busy. We ended up parking on the street next to the restaurant, it really wasn't that big of a deal. It definitely doesn't look like much on the outside, but you can tell with how paced it is, that its gotta be something special.
We went in and every table was taken. There were two spots at the bar that face into the open kitchen and we were totally fine with that. Gave us something fun to watch while we were waiting for our food. My husband was instantly in heaven once we were seated and we could take it all in. The decor, the set up, everything was ""spot on"", says he.
Our server was quick to greet us and get things started. We both got a glass of wine. I chose mine based upon a prior Yelp reviewers Tip by Greg B who said to try the ""Montepulciano D' Abruzzo"" and WOW did that not disappoint! A nice wine, full of flavor. My husband got the Chianti because thats his favorite. He really enjoyed it. It was a bit too light for my tasting.
For dinner we got the Giovanni per all of the recommendations on Yelp. I think is was between that or the Diavola (which had a bunch of good reviews as well) but we just decided on the Geo and it was GREAT! Not to mention we timed it and I think it was 90 seconds it took from the pizza to go from the oven to our plates. Incredible! Easily the best and most authentic pizza we have had.
We finished off with some Spumoni which was again, delicious.
Truly everything here tasted heavenly. The food comes out fast so I can see how tables can be turned quickly, unless you have people wanting to stay and chat. But its well worth the wait! I hope that they open up another location, because it would really do well!
We will definitely be back again and again!",,,

Their pizzas are insanely amazing. If you're looking for the perfect wood fired pizza with incredibly high quality ingredients, you're in luck.
The Margherita is a solid go-to - just an amazing cheesy and crispy experience. We always order our pizzas well done for that extra crispiness, so just a tip there if you like the same. The fun part of their pizzas is using the pizza scissors. I didn't realize those existed until visiting this place.
The toppings are super high quality, as I previously mentioned. For example, if you want mushrooms, you don't get plain white ones, you get chanterelle. My husband loves prosciutto and said there's is seriously awesome.
We've had a couple different salads and haven't quite found our fav yet. They had a Caesar, but we noticed the second time we went that it wasn't on the menu. It was just ok - it used a bitter lettuce that just didn't work. We next tried a salad that had rainbow radishes (looking online I don't see it so I don't know the exact name). It was great for what it was, but we would still try another one.
Service has always been awesome. Plus, we haven't ever had to wait (even on a Saturday at about noon) - but we've only gone in colder months, so not sure if it's more packed when the weather is nice.
Oh - and they have a nice wine menu, too (we've tried a few different reds and all have been nice - a stand out one to me is the Walla Walla Sangiovese).

The appetizers were also wonderfully accompanied by a great drink menu. They had a great assortment of craft beers and cocktails. We ordered the meatballs to start and they were so flavorful, most, and delicious. Would recommend.

The prices were also really good considering the location, the wonderful ambiance, and the amazing food. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone visiting Bainbrdige.

So you can believe me when i say Bruciato makes some of the best pizza I've ever had. We could have eaten 5 more pizzas and never had enough because it was so delicious. Perfectly crispy crust, delicious tomatoes, cheese and basil. The salad was delicious and the ambiance and drinks were so well done. Next time I am in Seattle and ferry to Bainbridge my first stop will be Bruciato.",,,

Provo, UT","Bruciato is an modernized pizza restaurant located right on the main street on Bainbridge island. We stopped by as we were getting off the ferry for lunch and everything was perfect! The pizza was top notch, the location was great, and the decor was super cool. It made the perfect addition to a Sunday outing with family!
We ordered two pizzas for our group of four and loved both of them. The pizza is thin with a crispy wood-fired crust baked in a oven at the back of the restaurant. Each pizza is covered with gourmet toppings - one of our pizzas was loaded with four different fancy cheeses and the other with prosciutto and arugula. The pizza comes out whole and they give you scissors to cut the pizzas into slices right at the table. It's a unique touch!
Besides the pizza, maybe my favorite part of Bruciato is the restaurant itself! The restaurant has a modern, industrial vibe that feels simple and upscale. Definitely more modern and fun than a run of the mill pizza joint. I loved all of the cool details throughout the restaurant like the high arched ceilings, metal light fixtures, and firewood stacked all around the oven. The front of the restaurant even has a giant articulated glass door that opens up on the street. When it's open on a nice day it feels like you're eating outside!
We came on a Sunday afternoon around 130 and had about a 20 minute wait for our group of four. We walked around the street and checked out the cool shops and they texted us when our table was ready.
If you're passing through Bainbridge or are looking for a cool spot on a day trip, Bruciato is the place for you!",,,

We obviously grabbed pizza and a salad! We grabbed a margherita pizza and insalata verde. The choice of pizza and salad was perfect for this weather! It was something filling but not too heavy. The basil on the pizza was so yummy, that crispiness with the tangy margherita sauce was the perfect combo. But man, whoever decided to add peppadews to that salad def did not disappoint!
Staff here was super friendly! Luckily we came before the rush, so we didn't have to wait in line. We got seated near the window which had the perfect lighting and breeze. After lunch, you have plenty of boutiques, cafes, desserts to visit.",,,

We often visit friends that live on the island, and then venture to Seattle for an upscale vegan experience; but no more, enter Bruciato!
Bruciato is located along Winslow Way, which serves as the Island's quaint Main Street.
Wafts of the Wood-fired pizza greet you as you enter.
Our party of 6 was lucky enough to be sat immediately. As soon as we sat down, the line outside started to form.
The look:
Concrete floors, exposed wood beams, and open duct work. An open kitchen and bar let you watch the magic happen.
There is shelf that holds giant green jars that looked a little willy-nilly. It made me nervous.
As we scanned the menu, I ordered their take on an Old Fashioned. It was perfect!
We devoured the following:
Olive e focaccia: $6
Wood-fired flatbread. A nice starter while browsing the menu.
Insalata Verde: $12
Mixed green salad with pickled shallots, turmeric pickled cauliflower, and a red wine vinaigrette. This was a nice balance of ingredients perfectly dressed.
Funghi: $22
blue oyster and piopini mushrooms, house-made VEGAN mozzarella. OMG! I still dream about this pizza.
Side-note:
Pizza comes with scissors, cut- to-eat.
I washed it down with a lovely glass of Ros茅.
Parking is on the street, and can be daunting at busier times.
Service was excellent, highly recommended!

Kent, WA","On an impromptu trip for lunch to Bainbridge, my colleague from the island suggested we try pizza here, and I was blown away by the options here. Everything was freshly made and extremely appetizing. Given that this was more of a business lunch, I did not pay very close attention to the drink list, but the wine selection seemed very good from my vantage point. They have some amazing flavors and ingredients that you won't find many other places. Flowers and mushrooms on pizza?! It was amazing. My only disappointment is I didn't take a picture of it when it was fresh because it was a beautiful pie. Would definitely go back.
This establishment is right in the heart of downtown and gives you amazing seating options by their front window on a beautiful day. You couldn't ask for a better place for a relaxing lunch or dinner with good friends and neighbors. The service was great as well, and they managed the lunch rush well, especially for a day when everyone was out trying to enjoy the weather. The idea here is sharing a pie or admitting you're going take the rest with you and probably destroy it on the ferry back to the mainland. It would definitely be a great place to take a larger group so you can cut it up (yes I said cut) and share with more. Speaking of cutting it up, they give you pizza shears instead of a pizza slicer, and it works out amazing. At first I was confused but once I used it, I loved it. Need to plan more trips to Bainbridge so I can enjoy places like this!",,,

The meatballs were definitely big, juicy, and flavorful (get your head out of the gutter). I can really taste a variety of italian herbs and the marinara? sauce is the perfect balance between garlicy, sweet, and salty.
The pizza with dates was also just as perfect, the crust was light, the dates added a great sweetness to accompany the saltiness of the prosciutto.
A true gem on Bainbridge Island!",,,
Bruciato,(206) 201-3462,"Ron K.
San Jose, CA","This turned out to be a great find. I was trying to find a more upscale spot to check out with some veggie options and this place was recommended by some local friends. I'm not sure how long it has been at this location here but I know out all the times I've visited Bainbridge I've never been to this spot. Mind you the Island is not very veggie friendly like Seattle so when you do find something you jump on the chance.
Very cool open space that I would not call a storybook out of Italy, especially with the Miley Syrus and The Smiths playing in the background, but the working prechuto slicer at the bar and the stacked logs next to the Italian wood oven gets you pretty close to the real thing...
This place has a menu that could make any veg-head like me excited but when you are on islands sometimes the servers aren't like getting veg questions daily so it's a bit difficult to get the straight scoop on what's really in all of their dishes. For example I was inquiring on two dishes that are veg friendly but I got a hesitant response. I mean I read the full secription and it all seemed innocent of any animals but? For example they had a great looking dish of polenta with mushrooms Polenta al fungi that looked delicious or a veggie soup Zuppa de zucca but there seemed to be issues making vegan. All the salads were not vegan and they were like full sized entrees and no ability to get half sizes. Even the pizza menu is a bit confusing as I was trying to get a specialized vegan one but they didn't seem to have an easy way to do that except for adding things to a margarita pizza with their vegan house made cheese. But I didn't even want to ask the price of adding to an already $18 pizza so stuck to their single offering called Vegano. This had olives kale potato's roasted onions veg mozzarella and parm.
They have a pretty good wine and beer menu also. They had two Breakside ipas on tap one was a winter IPA that was pretty tasty and went for that!
One fun little fact about this place is they bring scissors with your pizza to do your own cutting. They will do the cutting it up if you want but I kind of got into it because you can make your exact size slices which for me are tiny 2 inch wide slices:). And now to the pizza taste it was 5 stars for sure. The crust was ultra thin but the crust was chewy and full of flavor. The red sauce was super tasty and all the toppings were very good. If I could customize which I'll try next time to do would be to sub out the potato for some mushrooms. I've never quite got why people like potatoes on a dough crust pizza. I guess it's filling when you are in the Northwest. My friend is a totally meat eater and she gave me no leftovers to eat so there you go on an endorsement!
Service is very friendly and efficient. Sometimes I thought it was a bit too quick to either take orders or close out bill but the place was not that crowded so it's understandable.
To sum up great place that could be improved if they allow more modifications without charging you a fortune. Also maybe mark up the menu to what you can veganify would be helpful. Overall if you are on this Island I would run not walk here as it's one of the few veggie friendly spots on the island. Definitely close to 5 star material at least the time I checked this place out.",,,
Bruciato,(206) 201-3462,"Robert B.
Seattle, WA","This might be an unfair review. I reserve the right to revise up.
THE ROSES: Truly excellent pizza. Pizzas are made in a wood fired (apple wood) oven in the back on the dining area, and they're done in the Neapolitan style. Large selection of pizzas featuring what appear to be only the finest in toppings. Classic Italian and artisan styles; don't even THINK of asking for Canadian Bacon and pineapple here. Good selection of top-quality and rather creative appetizers and salads. Remarkably pleasant and professional staff, especially when you consider that they'd been slammed on a Friday night for probably at least five hours! Remarkably decent prices, when you consider the neighborhood and the quality.
THE THORNS: Dining room is a bit loud, and I wasn't crazy about the hip-hop heavy playlist. The big deal is that they really need to work on the estimates for wait times that they give. Our one-hour wait was more like two hours. Good thing it was Art Walk night, so we had something to do!
WHY TWO STARS? I really think they could've done a better job with estimating the wait times, or at least acknowledged that they kind of sold us a bill of goods. I realize that this is more art than science, but I think they could've done better.
TOP TIP: Look into trying Yelp's 'Waitlist' feature. Give people an opportunity to hang out on their boat for cocktails while they wait for their table!
THE VERDICT: Superb pizza that is worth the wait, but only just so. Tread carefully, my friends: you're the only game in town right now for top-tier pizza, but if you continue to leave patrons waiting for hours, someone could come and eat your lunch. Just sayin'...",,,

From a design standpoint, the restaurant is beautiful and elegant. Colored vases line the walls toward the pizza oven with an intricate white tile exterior. The food was amazing. The margherita pizza was good and checked all the boxes, but nothing exciting about it. The funghi was delicious. The generous amount of mushrooms added a crunch in addition to it's earthy flavorful profile. And the cipolla was something I've never had before, and I'm so glad I tried it because now I will be looking out for it at other pizza places. Honey and sheep cheese, straight up magical...

Seattle, WA","If you work in South Lake Union, you know lunch time (11:30am-2pm) can be a bit of a mad house when it comes to finding food without crazy lines.
Having recently moved to Seattle, I've had some difficulty finding a local pizzeria that offers quality without having to spend an outrageous amount (seriously, $30 cheese or pepperoni pies?). Tutta Bella is one of the first local options I've found that serves up a tasty pizza AND with a reasonable price.
From the host to our server, the staff was friendly and helpful with suggesting some of their favorites. We were given the option of where to sit (sort of unheard of with a lunch rush), and opted for the counter so we could watch the pizza making. It's pretty fun to see the pizza you just ordered get made in front of you, and to see it cook.
They do offer lunch specials (mini pizza for a few bucks off), but if you're hungry enough I'd just go with the regular or larger option.
The space was relatively packed, but service was prompt with no considerable lags between ordering to getting our food to paying. Perfect if you're popping in for a quick lunch break.
I'll definitely come back again and try some of their other options.
Tips:
-Limited parking
-If you're coming from Westlake Ave, there's a large staircase on the right of Whole Foods that leads up to Tutta Bella (which is at the top to the left)
-Tutta Bella does have a loyalty program, be sure to grab one of the cards with the information to download the app/redeem (if your server hasn't included it with the bill)",,,

The food came out in a very reasonable amount of time and tasted quite good. However, the pizza had some really burnt spots that you'd definitely want to avoid eating. I also felt like the pizza was mostly crust, which has to be my least favorite part of pizza. Some of the menu items are a bit overpriced, especially the garlic knots.

Seattle, WA","After living in Napoli, Italy for 6 months and developing a taste bud for authentic Italian cuisine and Neapolitan pizzas, I don't usually bother with pizzas back home as they usually are not worth the task. I've been hankering for Neapolitan pizzas for quite some time now and we had just spent all day unpacking into our new home. We decided to treat ourselves for pizza and the only one I'd want is a Neapolitan one that I didn''t have to drive to and there is was, Tutta Bella... 2 minutes walk from our new apartment (Kiara).
Is it good? Why, Yes, why yes it is. At least mine was. It was so good I didn't bother tasting my husband's pizza. But let me start with the starter.
Salad (Ceasar salad with anchovies) - the bite, bursting with flavors. From the lemon zest to the fresh cracked peppercorns to the crunch in romaine lettuces to the sinking of the teeth into the cheese slices to the burnt notes of the crouton toasts... all, perfecto! The anchovies bring it allllll in.
Pizza (The Roberto) - extra virgin olive oil, pistachio pur茅e, Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella, smoked buffalo mozzarella, basil, egg (per request), finished with pecorino Romano. Did I mention, PISTACHIO PUR脡E? Have you tried, pistachio pur茅e? On a pizza? I highly doubt it. Pizzas come with all sort of crazy toppings theses days, pistachio should definitely be one of them! Bc is not a big meat/chicken eater, I get egg on everything. I don't think it would've been as good without the egg. Perfectly cooked and runny. It was goood you should've seen our plates : empty.
Dessert (Gelato)- first timers get a freebie! Hubby and I both got ours complimented. What a nice treat! His was salted caramel, mine the seasonal orange. His was a little salty and mine was refreshing but a little too sweet. We both aren't avid sugar eaters but we both finished our desserts.
Atmosphere : smacking view of the iconic Seattle Space Needle. Romantic views of city lights. Pretty much the cleanest polished looking pizzeria I'd ever been to, surpassing ones in LA and California Pizza Kitchens, yet, chillaxed. Rooftop patios = DOG FRIENDLY :).
Upstairs from Whole Foods.
Opens late.
Service : wonderful. Helpful, attentive, and not overbearing.
Sustainability : Reusables dining in. Cardboard boxes takeout/delivery. Recycles & composts.
Happy hour : Daily (3-6 / 9-close)

It was definitely one of the better salads I have ever had. The chicken was so nice and crispy. I am used to chicken in salad being just boiled or grilled, not very flavorful. But the chicken in this salad had a nice crust on it. The contents in the salad were also very satisfying. The cheese and ham were my favorite. I also got a lemoncoco on the side, this was alright. I am not sure what I was expecting, but it was an interesting flavor. It tasted like a thicker coconut water to me, I was not a fan.

The first time we dined in. Ordered 1 appetizer and 2 pizzas. The appetizer which had meatballs was impressive. Then the pizzas arrive. The dough was so chewy despite the bread being good quality. The execution was terrible and as a result we had an upset stomach the next day. It's possible they used the dough past it's expiration date because it didn't settle well in my stomach.
The second time we ordered pickup. I decided to give this pace another try. It was a mistake.
The second time the pizza was completely soggy. The pasta carbonara was unseasoned and dry. It tasted miserable.
A place like this in South Lake Union does not deserve to exist. And I am confident the reviews here are all astroturfed.

Everything was medicore. Nothing much to have about. The server was pleasant and sweet but took a while to bring stuff around.
We also got two desserts , a tiramisu and a Nutella calzone.

The carbonara came out last and we sat around for 15 or 20 minutes after we finished the pizza and burrata. Unfortunately, it was super bland. I tried to make sure I tossed it with the sauce and added extra cheese to give it a chance, but it just didn't taste good. It tasted like unsalted butter pasta. I ate a few bites and sent it back because I didn't want to just eat empty carbs. After that moment the wait staff wasn't as friendly as they were before.

As their name indicates, their specialty is the Neapolitan Pizza. They also have salads, pastas, and gelato for dessert. I got the personal size (10 inch) prosciutto and arugula pizza. They put plenty of arugula on the pizza. The pizza tasted quite good, as the saltiness of the prosciutto blends well with the cheesy aroma of the pizza and the fresh arugula. A 10 inch pizza was the perfect portion for me. If you go during happy hour (4-6, and 9 to close), you get a small discount on the pizzas and cocktails.",,,

I had the Roberto pizza and it was very nice, the buffalo cheese adds a little smokey flavor which was very refreshing on the palate. Of course I splurged and got the Tutta Bella Amber Ale (handcrafted by them). The gelato which I got the orange flavor, adds a nice citrus flavor, and tastes just like creamsicle! The espresso being strong adds a nice bitter taste which limits the sweetness of the gelato.

If you order the tasting menu you get all of the appetizers, pastas and mains to share with the table. We always go with the wine parings when we do the tasting menu. However they make some yummy and creative cocktails too so check out the drink specials too!
Our menu faves are the beef tartare, the beets and goat cheese, and practically any of their fabulous fresh pasta dishes. I will typically go with a beef or pork entree and my partner will usually have the fish. We are never disappointed.",,,

North Bend, WA","Met a friend for dinner here one night and enjoyed the urban design, innovative menu, and fresh ingredients. The dining area is pretty small and this place fills up around dinner time, so I recommend you have reservations or you'll be lucky enough to even get bar seating like I was.
The set up is one small dining area with an open kitchen on one side and a small bar with rather uncomfortable but stylish bar stools.The pragmatic husband of mine has made me dislike fashion over practicality! What I did love, was the large open windows facing the street that can open up to their little patio space in the summer. Their Scandinavian style dishware was also a huge hit with me.
The bartender was our server and she did a great job the whole night and was actually really patient with us when we were literally the last ones in the restaurant after closing time. Their menu is limited and didn't have many 'sharing' style plates, so come prepared to order a la carte for each person. Their menu is separated into vegetables, pasta (no gluten free options), and proteins. Being celiac it was a little difficult for me to order here but they tried to accommodate me which I always appreciate.
We sampled the burrata and they put the bread on the side, the snap peas, and brussels sprouts. All were great and I wish I could have sampled the protein section but the friend I was with only wanted snacks. Everything came out beautifully plated and had excellent flavors. Will have to come back soon to explore more of their seasonal menu.",,,

Seattle, WA","WOW really enjoyed this place tonight. We booked a 7 pm reservation for two on a Thursday evening just for fun. Came in to a nice open bar/kitchen space with intimate table settings. There were maybe 10 tables total ranging from 2 tops to 4 tops for the most part as well as some bar seats.
Drinks - enjoyed my cocktail (union mezcal drink) but switched over to wine as it felt more fitting with pasta. Decent wine by the glass list with a lot of variety, as well as some bottle options. I really liked the Zingari Rosso which was a cherry-forward, lighter sangio blend.
Apps. I don't think we had one thing we didn't like. We started with a half dozen oysters. They weren't big but they were sure delicious. The vinaigrette was amazing. We also had beets and burrata. Beets were different than I've ever had them. They were yellow beets and more savory with herbs and arugula vs the traditional red beets with goat cheese and nuts that you can order at most places. The burrata with eggplant was a party in my mouth. The perfect mix of creamy and savory with the eggplant. The bread was oily (in a good way) and toasted to perfection.
Pasta. We ordered 3 because we couldn't choose. The squid ink tagliarini was the special of the night and my favorite one. It was savory and spicy and relatively light tasting with a good amount of dungeness crab. The tagliatelle was awesome as well with fresh egg noodles and oxtail. My least favorite was the agnolotti because it was sweet tasting and very rich (almost like a Cinnabon) but if you have a hankering for sweeter dishes, this is perfect for you. Definitely different vs other agnolotti dishes. Wouldn't order again but glad to have tried.
We passed on dessert because of the sheer amount of food we ordered but they had some interesting desserts including housemade limoncello. 2 drinks each and all that food was about $200 with tip which is a bit high for a random week day but it was well worth it and I basically have a full tagliatelle for lunch tomorrow.
We will be back! Thanks for the nice evening.",,,

Houston, TX","A friend recommended Vendemmia to me and I'm so glad I tried it! We made reservations for a Sunday evening and we're glad we did - cause all the tables were pretty full for a Sunday evening! We were celebrating a friend's bday. Service was great and everyone was friendly. The ambiance was good for a date - Dim lighting, easy atmosphere for conversation, not super huge or cramped.
*Hamachi Crudo - I've had this at so many restaurants, I almost feel like it's overdone. But this one was so fresh and so so different! It came with a green pickled blend on top - apparently gooseberry, cucumber and basil. Fresh and delicious! 5/5
*Snap Peas - with Dungeness Crab, Endive and Chives. I've never had snap peas served this way but the dish itself is light in flavor so you get the crunch of the snap peas but can still taste the Dungeness crab. I thought it needed more flavor, especially coming out directly after the hamachi crudo. 3/5
*Burrata - Bosc Pear, Pistachio and Grilled Bread. This dish was so good! We loved everything about the burrata spread and the mix of flavors with the pear! Bread was nice and toasty! 5/5
*Beef Tartare - shallot and grilled bread. This wasn't my favorite beef tartare cause the flavors were again light and there wasn't anything special about this tartare. 3/5
*Tagliatelle with Braised Duck - O.M.G and we have a winner for the night! This pasta dish was fantastic! Noodles cooked right, sauce in point, Duck was tender small pieces and definitely not gamey. My bf doesn't like Duck and loved this dish. There was a dried mushroom in the dish that gave it a crunch. Not sure with else but it was amazing! We all said we would come back just for this dish alone!! 6/5
*Rigatoni with a Lamb Ragu, oregano and pecorino. I think Vendemmia does pasta dishes best! This one can't compare to the braised duck tagliatelle but if we came and had this dish first, it would have been just as perfect! Good Ragu sauce, pasta cooked perfectly. 5/5
*Smoked Potato - tasted like it sounds with mustard and charred onion. Ok dish - nothing to rave about. 2/5
*Rainbow Carrots with pickled green walnuts, feta and honey. Sweet and delicious! Veggies done right! 4/5
*Tri Tip Steak with Celery Root, Squash and Watercress. One of my least favorite dishes of the night. The steak was tough and the flavors were just ok. 2/5
*Pork Chop with nectarine, olive and a verde. We didn't like any of the protein dishes at Vendemmia. Pork chop was tough and none of the flavors went together in this dish. The nectarine didn't add to the dish cause of the way it was done. The olives and the verde were a weird mix. Stick to pastas and some of the sides! 1/5
*Ricotta Cake, Pear Sorbet and Panna Cotta - the pear sorbet was the winner of the 3. So good and tasted so fresh with so much pear flavors! So good that my bf has been talking about it and looking for pear sorbet the last week. Yum! Ricotta cake was a nice moist cake - nothing special. And the panna cotta was very savory if you want a savory dessert. But do yourself a favor and get that pear sorbet!
Overall, a great dining experience! I would definitely come back but now I know what to order cause there were definitely dishes we loved and dishes we hated! More good dishes than bad though! Get the pastas!!!",,,

Seattle, WA","Overall, a quaint and romantic restaurant with good value for the quality of food served. We attended as a larger group (6), and they were able to accommodate us within the back private dining area (lovely design and private).
For food, we had the following: Hamachi (all loved; fresh and balanced), Snap Peas (salad format; creative and light), Brussels Sprouts (not recommended; basic), Shelling Beans (ok), Burrata (delicious), Garganelli (beautiful smoked pork), Pure Cod (very well done; fresh; light), Spaghetti (great).
For drinks we limited our cocktails as we found variety limited. The negroni was nothing special and not worth the price. There was a great table red for $9, with heavy pours.",,,

Seattle, WA","What a wonderful night out. My partner and I were craving pasta and ice cream when we decided to venture into Madrona for date night. We enjoyed some wonderful Italian food and cocktails that evening.
Food: pasta is fresh and to die for. Incredibly rich and flavorful with generous portion sizing. We started with an appetizer of oysters which were perfectly fine, but priced a bit higher than market value.
Cocktails: spirit forward and expertly made. Honestly there nothing more to say
Atmosphere: The staff was delightful. There's a small indoor are and even smaller patio seating. Interestingly, they reported being booked up on the phone but the restaurant didn't fill the entire evening. Fortunately, the patio is first come first serve so we were seated quickly when we arrived.",,,

Our shared order of beef tartare served with garlic toast was so delightful and held our appetite over until the main courses arrive. I ordered the New York prime medium-rare while my girlfriend ordered the smoked potatoes, and both dishes were so good, it was almost sad when we completed our meals lol. While the inside was a bit loud with everyone speaking, the window table facing the street of the quiet neighbourhood definitely helped detract from the noise. The decor is fantastic and the staff is super friendly. If you want a more fancy feel to your dinner, check this place out. A little on the pricey side, but absolutely worth every penny spent!",,,

Seattle, WA","Came here for a friends birthday and I was intrigued to try out this highly reviewed spot. At first glance, its a classier, nice looking spot, and the menu prices confirm this first impression. Overall, it looks like a higher class tapas joint.
We ordered a few things for the table and I can attest that the food is of higher quality with its ingredients and flavor combinations refreshing & done well. My favorites were the lamb sirloin & burrata. Even though the bread was toasted a tad too long, it was hard to bite into, but simply bend the bread a bit and the crust will yield when biting into it. The cheese mixed with the hearty eggplant was a light creamy combination that was surprising. The lamb was beyond amazing with the herbs, mustard seed, and especially the mint. The rest of the dishes were pretty average. I would recommend ordering at least 1 pasta as its somewhat filling for the price compared to the other dishes. Even though I've had better pasta, I can say that its above average.
If you're looking for a nice date spot, or just some higher quality, lower quantity food, I'd recommend checking out this spot! Some items are hit or miss, but I was overall satisfied. Since the menu rotates I wouldn't mind coming back here and there, but its a bit expensive for a commonly visited spot.",,,

Orange, CA","Here's the short version of this. Food: fantastic. Cannot be beat. Service: poor. Beyond poor.
We are visiting from California and decided we wanted good food. We have a two year old that typically does well when we take him to eat. Yesterday was not the case. The restaurant staff made it very clear this place is not child friendly. However, I will not write a whole review just on this. Here are the pros and cons.
Pros:
-Hanger steak. Delicious. Tastes like it was sous vide then finished on the grill. Perfectly done.
-Black cod was slightly fishy. Other food it was paired with was spot on and cut through the fish taste. Incredible.
- The beef tartare appetizer was savory. Meaty and beautiful.
- Hamachi appetizer in at a loss for words. Fresh. Savory.
Cons:
- Servers. Big party came in before us. I asked if they were making all their food first and if ours would be coming up. Their response ""everything is made to order and takes time to come to you."" Being from the food industry, this is an idiotic response. For one, it's an open kitchen and I can clearly see everything is being made.
- Warm/cold food. Steak was amazing, but when it arrived to us, it was warm at best.
- Inconsistent seasoning. Some dishes were almost too heavy on the salt. Some had none.
Overall, I rate the food at a 4.5 or even a five. The service a 1. Thus the 3 star rating.",,,

Seattle, WA","Best Restaurant Week restaurant!!! I'm so glad my friend brought me here (shoutout to Mona - sup girlfriend). They give the table all 4 appetizers options on the prix fixe, and you pick 1 entree and 1 dessert.
Mizuna Salad (4/5): Great start to the meal, loved the crushed almonds/cheese on this salad
Calamari (4/5): Super refreshing! Not what you expect - the calamari is not deep fried and there's no breading (which makes it look naked) but it went great with celery and cauliflower. Healthy calamari option :)
Asparagus on savory panna cotta (5/5): I had never heard of a savory panna cotta before but that stuff comes from the Italian heavens. It's this amazing garlicky sauce that would make any vegetable your favorite.
Tagliatelle with ricotta and peas (5/5): Perfect pasta texture! The ricotta made the pasta interestingly sour but it really balanced out the cheesiness of this dish. Loved this creative pasta!
Risotto, mascarpone, mint (4/5): Would have preferred it if it weren't made with mixed grains (brown rice), but this felt like a healthy option!
Duck confit (5/5): ......THIS DUCK is why I will be returning to Vendemmia. Perfectly crisp skin on a melt-in-your-mouth duck leg, the best finely-mashed potatoes on the side, and the green
/ orange drizzle sauces made this dish top notch. I'd be hard pressed to find a more delicious duck.
Halibut (4/5): Nice crispy skin on this halibut too, but does not compare to the duck :)
Rhubarb panna cotta (5/5): If you like panna cotta, you will LOVE this jiggly wiggly panna cotta topped with oats.
Ricotta cake (5/5): My favorite dessert of the night - it looks like a cheese cake but it's not nearly as creamy/fatty/sweet. The cake itself is not sweet, but the raisins and almonds on the side made this dish so surprisingly great!
Tiramisu (5/5): It comes to your table as a deconstructed tiramisu cake, with pieces all over the place, which is pretty cool. Definitely one of the healthier tiramisu's I've had (seems to be a common thread among all their dishes) and I love that!
I'll be back, Vendemmia! And please have the duck confit on your rotating menu when I'm there!!",,,

We started with, penn cove oysters, juicy heirloom tomatoes, garden cucumbers, the sweetest melons I've had in a long time and the most delicious fish crostini. We gobbled everything up! Then came the hamachi collar! OMG!! I literally sucked the bones clean I kid you not. We were given not 1 pasta dish, but 3! The server let us put in a preference of which of the 4 pastas we wanted. We opted for the agnolotti. All of the pastas were delicious! We finished with 2 different desserts, a chocolate dessert with a hint of coffee and a yummy almond cake with peach compote. My favs of the night were the heirloom tomatoes, melon appetizer, hamachi collar, fish crostini, the agnolotti and the almond cake dessert, basically everything was delicious!",,,

Seattle, WA","Seattle Restaurant Week April 2018
Service: Bad. She forgot one of the 4 starters and we didn't realize this until after we paid and I snapped a photo of the menu for Yelp. Her response? ""Sorry, I wish you had told me earlier."" And that was it. Keeping track of the courses is her job, not mine. We put 2 cards down, she asked if we wanted to split it and she ran my card twice. Our server Anna basically did a crappy job.
Food:
Starters
1. Octopus--Octopus was so tender and the cauliflower had a nice crunch.
2. Asparagus--Missing
3. Mizuno salad--Felt very spring. It was a nice balance to the heavier pasta.
4. Tagliatelle--My favorite after the octopus. The pasta had fresh peas (a bit too firm) and a minty cream sauce.
Main
Halibut--Preparation could be better. One piece of halibut was nicely seared and the other had no sear on it at all so that nice crunchy top was missing. The fish itself was very tender but I could have used a bit more sauce.
Dessert
1. Ricotta cake--It was served warm!! Make sure to get this. It was so tender and we loved the grapes and almonds on top.
2. Panna Cotta--Skip. It was creamy and dense but the topping didn't do much for it. I would opt for the tiramisu instead. That looked better once i saw it.
I still think this place is a good deal for SRW but next time I'm going to watch the server closely to make sure I get everything that I paid for.",,,

Kenmore, WA","We love coming to Vendemmia! Their simple spaghetti never disappoints. The pastas tend to be pretty al dente, which is my preference. The veggies and small plates that I've tried over time have always been good. I tried the beef tartare on my most recent trip and was very happy with it. Nice wine selection.
The only negative comment I have is that the tomato based meat pastas tend to be salty (aside from one or two staples, their pasta selection changes frequently, and there are usually one or two meat ones). Most recently, it was the beef shank paccheri that was borderline TOO salty. Everything was cooked well and the flavors/richness were good, but definitely very salty. My boyfriend agreed, and he even had a cold that was dulling his taste buds. Normally I would say this is a one-off, but I've had similar experiences in previous visits, one involving some type of a bolognese sauce. So, we always get one spaghetti to be safe :)
I haven't been here for Happy Hour yet (I attached a menu since I couldn't find one posted anywhere) but based on the prices it seems like a great deal to get some of their staples. Absolutely would be back to try the HH tartare, spaghetti, and a glass of wine :)",,,

Shoreline, WA","This is a two part Yelp belated post from a birthday celebration (6/9/15) and for Day 1 of Seattle Restaurant Week campaign (10/15/17). Both dinner visits were specifically with the intent of celebrating at Vendemmia.
The first visit was a culinary revelation along the retail and restaurant row on 34th Avenue in Seattle's Madrona neighborhood. Definitely something different from my visits at St. Clouds or Hi Spot Caf茅. This uplifted my spirits since I was worn out juggling a new job and dealing with an ailing parent. As a cancer warrior, I treasure each birthday I get to celebrate. I recall the lovely atmosphere, impeccable service, and amazing food. It was a feast for the senses. I just located my digital photos and posted them this evening (11/15/17). Who knows where that digital camera went? Thank goodness I had transferred these photos to a file on my ancient laptop.
In the interim, I had enjoyed several visits to the late Contadino over on 19th E in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Still hadn't checked out East Anchor Seafood (Madrona) or Raccolto (West Seattle) though. I was saddened when Contadino had closed. I had made a mental note that I needed to revisit Vendemmia.
I had that opportunity a month ago (10/15/17) during the first day of the Seattle Restaurant Week (SRW) campaign. My sennin-so shiatsu LMP reminded me that I really needed to make the effort to take better care of myself and partake in fun activities of my choosing. Gave myself plenty of time to deal with traffic, found parking by Vendemmia, but had a tiny mocha first at a nearby indie caf茅. Yes, it would have been more enjoyable to be with others, but this 6pm reservation was solo for the purpose of taking myself out on a 'date'. Life's too short to expect magic to happen, especially with my chaotic roller coaster called life.
I was seated at a two top by the entrance and host stand. I had a great view of the open kitchen, but was not distracted by the full restaurant and bar scene. I was really focused on each dish brought to my table. I was shocked that I was given all four of the starters. So rather than the expected three courses for SRW, I had experienced six!
The flavors (with a capitol F), textures, visual composition were incredible. I had to remind myself that I had to pace myself. I still ended up having to box up some of my starters (charred broccoli and chicory apple salad) but definitely the Hamachi crudo and pork loin with tonnato were devoured! Same fate happened with half of the herb stuffed porchetta with autumn squash and pickled chanterelles. Made for an amazing lunch the next day. I barely made it through the dessert selected, the baked budino, as I thought of the Monty Python reference of 'one thin mint'. Overindulged, but overall dining experience was phenomenal.
The cuisine and service were memorable that photos from 6/9/15 and my visit a month ago on 10/15/17 remain vivid. Vendemmia is definitely highly recommended!",,,

Cons:
Apparently they released a new menu the day before we came and boy if I knew I would NOT have come here. Way over priced for the type of food you get, basic bar food at restaurant prices. I was planning on coming and getting food all afternoon for the game but fries alone were almost 10$ after tax. Way way way overpriced for what food you get.

I got to the eatery about 30 minutes after they opened. There were only two others in the restaurant. The bartender chatted up all the patrons and was so nice to interact with. Food came out quickly and the plates were properly warmed. I was impressed that the place had large screen TVs all around each wall of the space which was great. My only gripe was they were mounted close to the ceiling. So Monday Night Football was on the screen in front of me at the bar and I had to strain my neck a little. All in all a decent spot. I really want to rate this higher, but with the prices/portion ratio is a bit off. I will visit again when there are more patrons. Would like to see service with more people in the spot",,,

The dressing the salad dressing that came with the salad brought all the flavors together and really set the salad off. I can go on record and say that this is by far one of the best salads that i have ever had. My friends order a Cajun Chicken sandwich and they said that it was delicious as well.

Appetizer was crab cakes. It was surprisingly a lot. Came with 2 patties the size of a bk whopper.
Entree was was seared ahi tuna. It was decent. Tuna tasted fresh. Visually, it looked pretty light. But it got me pretty full. Maybe because the crab cakes were so huge. Overall, I can't give too many points for vibes, since it was a Sunday night. Flavors for pretty average, but quality of ingredients keep it above average.

Renton, WA",The Brick recently changed their menu again. I miss the Cajun chicken sandwich. I only eat white meat and was glad to have this on the menu. The have since removed it. I asked the server if I could have the chicken sandwich from the old menu and he said yes. WHoooHOOOO. Unfortunately when it came out it is not the same sandwich. It is sliced chicken on a bun. This does not make a good sandwich. The pieces kept falling out of the bread. It was a horrible way to eat. The original was the reason I came to the brick repeatedly. Since that sandwich is gone I don't find anything comparable on the menu. Guess I will have to find another Cajun chicken somewhere else.,,,

It took at least 15 minutes for the waiter to come to our table. We ordered drinks and dinner. It took around another 10 minutes for the waiter to bring the drinks over. She was doubling as a bartender too. It took around 40 more minutes to get our food...that's almost an hour since we got there. Not acceptable. Fish from fish and chips was over fried and hard. My wife's flank steak order was sirloin tip according to her, and it was pink on the inside though she ordered it medium well.
All in all, we were pretty disappointed...",,,

I loved the beer selection at the Brick. They had a whole bunch of local beers that you don't find at many other places, which that alone would keep me coming back.
The food was really good as well! I had a grilled cheese with bacon and peppers and it was awesome! I think it was about $12 which is reasonable.
They also have games out for customers to play, which is always fun when drinking beer with your friends.",,,

With that said...
I have now had three bad meals in a row and I am ready to stop trying. That is big bucks I will never get back. How do you screw up a BLT? The bacon was so overcooked that it was more like burnt bacon dust than meat. The ""Philly cheese steak"" was not good and didn't even come with the advertised aioli sauce. My fries sucked and were cold. How on Earth can you make a bad cheese steak? I don't even remember what they screwed up before that but I still remember the dissapointment coupled with a 70 dollar check.
I have had everything on the menu in the past and it ALL used to be good.
Now, I am afraid to order anything.
I sure hope they fix it back to the way it was. There is nothing like this place in the highlands.",,,

No acknowledgement even though both of them looked straight at us. Blonde girl started cleaning one of the machines and the bearded guy just kept talking to his friends. We sat the table for 15 mins and neither of them brought a menu or said Hi to us. After I began staring at the girl wondering why we were being ignored, a white couple came in and sat at the bar. Within 30 seconds he had poured them waters and took their order. He made their drinks and we had yet to be greeted or brought a drink menu. Every person in the bar was white including the couple that came in. Coincidence??? Thank you for ruining our evening and reaffirming that asian people are not welcome at the pub.",,,

Seattle, WA","True to its name, this place serves up a mean sandwich! There are good restaurants, and then there are restaurants whose food is worthy of random cravings that could happen on any day at any time. Mean sandwich falls squarely in the latter category for me.
The Midnight At the Oasis, the falafel-based sandwich, is one of the best vegan sandwiches I've had anywhere. It simply can't be beet ;)
The chicken cutlet sandwich is SO delicious - it's the one I crave the most when I think of Mean Sandwich.
I've also had one bite of my friend's fish sandwich, which I found to be tasty with inventive flavors.
I'm not a huge fan of the potato skins and ins - I find them to be too crisp and browned for my tastes, but that won't keep me from coming back for the sandwiches (I do wish they offered an additional side dish option or two, though)!",,,

San Francisco, CA","We snuck into Mean Sandwich just before they were going to close for Thanksgiving week. So lucky us. Unluckily they were doing a fried chicken pop-up that same day and it was bonkers inside with lots of people and orders backed up in the kitchen. They did offer to send our food to the brewery next door if we chose to wait there instead but we decided to walk around the neighborhood and come back.
We ordered the steak tartare club and a side of salt and pepper 'skins and ins. It took about 35 minutes for our food. The steak tartare is labor intensive so due to the rush they were batching them as orders came in I think.
Worth it though! What an incredible idea to substitute steak tartare in spicy yuzu mayo for the T in the BLT. And with chewy dense rye bread. The sandwich doesn't look like much but I recommend sharing if you want to include a generous helping of skins as well.
Speaking of which, why has no one else thought about deep frying potato skins? Wonderfully salty, peppery, crispy with yummy soft potato insides. Dangerously addictive and filling. Goes great with beer :-).
Definitely want to come back and try the Midnight at the Oasis next time we're in town.",,,

The burger here is smashed to perfection with very crispy sides and juicy throughout. I'm not a fan of mustard or raw onions on a burger but boy, do they go well with this burger at Mean Sandwich. I'm a fan!
The ""fries"" are not really fries but fried potatoes with skin. I suspect they're baked first and then fried later: Whatever they do with them, they're quite magical :) Crispy skins with the meaty center in that spud.
If you've been to any Fredy's Steakhouse chain location, this is an elevated version of that kind of a burger.
I had a chat with the staff present and they were really friendly and engaging in conversation.

San Diego, CA","Case of ordering wrong? Not sure. We actually made a u-turn to hit up this place to grab some lunch to go for our road trip up north. I always trust a local fav from yelp and the amount of patrons waiting for food further supported that. However, the combination of super long wait, high price and lackluster sandwiches have left me feeling a bit bitter abouts things.
I ordered the Buon Appetito (chicken cutlet sandwich) and the Jersey Sub (Italian sub) which are both $12. I thought it would be a quick process but the shop is small and it was very busy with orders going one at a time. It seemed like there was a combo of 4 or 5 people in the place ahead of me and who knows how many remote ordering. Pro tip (apparently) order ahead for pickup. I think my wait for 2 sandwiches was at least 25 mins.
Out of the 2, the Buon appetito was better, but still mediocre. But the Jersey was just plain bad. Whatever sub roll bread is used tasted like cheap white bread and was probably the primary reason it tasted badly... bread is important. It was just really plain tasting. I hate feeling so strongly on this but for nearly $30 for 2 sandwiches and being in a hurry, this visit was a big mistake and I should have just gotten sandwiches at Safeway for half the price.",,,

Initially we were going to go to the brewery next door after ordering sandwiches, but they were closed that day. Turns out that was OK, because we still got good beer with our sandwiches. The po'boy was slightly spicy, which I thought was delicious. It was a generous size, so I left feeling satisfied and refreshed. The space isn't exactly what I'd call ""comfortable,"" but that's OK because I was focused on the FOOD. Plus, they had puppy videos playing on the large TV in the corner.

Seattle, WA","Spent the afternoon with a friend who suggested we come here for lunch. She told me she had been here before and that I would like it; she was spot on.
Mean Sandwich is a small shop in Ballard that has no frills. Featured in Bon Appetit's 2017 List of America's Best New Restaurants, which I was informed about by my friend, I was intrigued to find a pretty basic menu: 7 sandwiches with 3 daily specials (soup may be one), 1 salad, 3 kinds of fat potato skins: salt & pepper or buffalo sauce or loaded-cheese/chives/bacon bits/more cheese, and yesterday's bun bread pudding.
While my friend and I were staring at the menu trying to decide what to order, a member of BOH came out, started singing loudly along with the 80's song playing and a huge grin. ""What should I get?!"" belted out my friend. ""Buon Appetito,"" he replied. She gushed. He kept singing. She informed me I had to get the skins and share them with her, so we got the salt and pepper.
Buon Appetito is a chicken sandwich with buffalo mayo, provolone, tomato, lettuce, and a pickled pepper relish. It looked huge. It was. My bud ended up taking half the sandwich home for later.
I got the Jersey Sub: capicola, provolone, salami, ham, lettuce, tomato, oregano, oil & vinegar (I asked for no red onion). Amazingly good. Crazy filling. The BREAD, man, the bread. It was like home, only a home I've never had.
Their icon is a pair of lady's lips with red lipstick, and they had free stickers. We each grabbed one. I slapped mine on the back of my day planner which is now in the recycling bin somewhere, and I really, really want to go back and get another sticker. And a sandwich.
You can get delivery. You can get catering. Adult beverages are available. I stuck with a bottle of root beer.
Outdoor seating where your pooch can also sit is available. Tables indoors along with bar stools facing the windows.
Food: 5
Service: 5
Ambiance: 4

Example of poor ratio: is The Fish is really good when you get the right bite and you get a bit of everything. However the sardines are like 10% of the sandwich. The bread is like 40% the sandwich and at times your just eating bread, which is also really good but I want something in between it. Also the fish is between. The lettuce and the slaw so one bite and half of the fish slides right out the back. Next, thing you know your eating a vegan sandwich of slaw and lettuce.",,,

We came based on the rumors of a delicious sandwich and were not disappointed. The Mean Corned Beef was awesome. A great version of a staple, including mint to add a touch of sweet flavor. The potato sides were also awesome. The part I really want to highlight though is Dan. When I asked what he recommended, he actually asked questions and gave great guidance. He also checked in on us to see if we were enjoying our sandwiches and asked what we thought of our selections. On our way out the door he thanked us for visiting. I know this all seems minor compared to the food but in today's hipster Seattle food scene I think it's rare to find a spot that not only has great food but also great people that appreciate their customers.

Seattle, WA","Mean Sandwich is a high quality sandwich place in the south end of Seattle's Ballard. It serves a limited range of well-produced sandwiches.
The restaurant is in an easy location to reach near the bridge. Parking nearby is limited and we were lucky to find a space in relatively short walking distance. We had come for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy.
Inside there is a very limited set of seating. This is a place that probably works best for takeout, since I wouldn't have felt really confident we could sit down, and don't want to let my food get cold. Service was counter-style, and friendly.
The menu is very limited. I knew this going in, but when faced with the actual choices, there are really only two that appeal to me much and really only one I definitely want.
There is a very appealing sounding side (fried potato lumps called skins and ins). This is exactly the sort of thing I typically love, but it was a bit overcooked and oversalted and I liked it but didn't love it, which was the big disappointment of the visit. I had expected this to be the high point.
When the sandwich arrived, it was great quality. I had a Buon Appetito (chicken). The bread is super - which I think is what tends to be most important. Not too sweet or soft. Great bread. The filling was a bit less exciting. It tasted like pretty normal sandwich fare. Not bad in any way, but not amazing. The portions were giant. With the skins, both of us had about twice as much food as we needed for a lunch and should have shared (except that we wanted completely different things).
Overall, this is a pretty good sandwich place. Much better than most of the regular chains or local places. If something from their tiny selection appeals to you, I recommend a visit. I doubt we'll be going very often, because we didn't bond with the choices we made and there isn't much more we want to try.",,,

Seattle, WA","Corvus had been a favorite for drinks, food, and brunch. Reasonably priced, friendly service, and decent acoustics made this a quiet standout. But the last few times have been disappointing, and last night brought back an old gripe about the new waitstaff that has landed in the Puget Sound area: they aren't professional. We arrived in time for happy hour, and ordered food from it. We also ordered two cocktails -- the menu said ""ALL COCKTAILS $2 OFF."" The toddy was ok, a little heavy-handed with the dried spices, and the Last Word was unbalanced, with too much sour competing with the Luxardo and both overwhelming the chartreuse. I could have sent it back, but wasn't in the mood to be ""that guy."" Food was fine as always, especially the fried okra and chickpeas.
When the the bill arrived, it showed the HH for happy hour pricing, but not on the Last Word. I pointed out the wording on the menu, and the waitress told me she only works one night a week and to take it up with the management/owner. No further help from her. Her service was basic, nothing stellar, but that last comment showed how little she cared about customers and the restaurant. Typically I would have sought out management and voiced my concerns, but last night I just wanted to get on with my evening.

Yesterday, it seems that other customers thought the French toast was such good stuff that it was all gone by the time I arrived, just after 1 pm. The server suggested ""Australian unicorn toast"" as a substitute; it's the special of the day because it was the Australian bartender's birthday. It was a slice of thick toast, sliced diagonally, and served with whipped butter and syrup - pretty much the way French toast would be served, except without the egg batter coating. The portion size was too small, but it was only $3, so I ordered another portion. That was about right, and my tab ended up smaller than usual.
Service has generally been good.
The decor is nice, with a lot of cool art - though strangely (given the place's name) there's only a small picture of a crow on one wall, and a giant picture of an owl on the long wall opposite the bar.

Pros:
Great for groups, lots of space and doesn't get too crowded which I like. Our server Andrew was amazing and really went out of his way to give us great service.
Cons:
Apparently they released a new menu the day before we came and boy if I knew I would NOT have come here. Way over priced for the type of food you get, basic bar food at restaurant prices. I was planning on coming and getting food all afternoon for the game but fries alone were almost 10$ after tax. Way way way overpriced for what food you get. My group ordered wings (which were good), nachos (alright), backyard burger (burnt) and drinks for each of us. Our bill was over $100. Somethings off if they think this will bring people in.",,,

I got to the eatery about 30 minutes after they opened. There were only two others in the restaurant. The bartender chatted up all the patrons and was so nice to interact with. Food came out quickly and the plates were properly warmed. I was impressed that the place had large screen TVs all around each wall of the space which was great. My only gripe was they were mounted close to the ceiling. So Monday Night Football was on the screen in front of me at the bar and I had to strain my neck a little. All in all a decent spot. I really want to rate this higher, but with the prices/portion ratio is a bit off. I will visit again when there are more patrons. Would like to see service with more people in the spot",,,

The salad itself was large and had a good portion of steak on it. The salad was fresh and so were all the toppings. The steak was seasoned perfectly and was cooked perfectly. Medium rare to medium. The dressing the salad dressing that came with the salad brought all the flavors together and really set the salad off. I can go on record and say that this is by far one of the best salads that i have ever had. My friends order a Cajun Chicken sandwich and they said that it was delicious as well.

Place was pretty slow with a couple other patrons. Server was welcoming and pretty cool. We had a table by the window. There was a lot of space.
I had a cocktail called Rob Roy. It was average.
Appetizer was crab cakes. It was surprisingly a lot. Came with 2 patties the size of a bk whopper.
Entree was was seared ahi tuna. It was decent. Tuna tasted fresh. Visually, it looked pretty light. But it got me pretty full. Maybe because the crab cakes were so huge. Overall, I can't give too many points for vibes, since it was a Sunday night. Flavors for pretty average, but quality of ingredients keep it above average. I'd say if you're looking for a chill place to have a conversation, this is a good place. If you're a flavor hunter, it's pretty average.",,,

I asked the server if I could have the chicken sandwich from the old menu and he said yes. WHoooHOOOO. Unfortunately when it came out it is not the same sandwich. It is sliced chicken on a bun. This does not make a good sandwich. The pieces kept falling out of the bread. It was a horrible way to eat. The original was the reason I came to the brick repeatedly.

She was doubling as a bartender too. It took around 40 more minutes to get our food...that's almost an hour since we got there. Not acceptable. Fish from fish and chips was over fried and hard.

I have now had three bad meals in a row and I am ready to stop trying. That is big bucks I will never get back. How do you screw up a BLT? The bacon was so overcooked that it was more like burnt bacon dust than meat. The ""Philly cheese steak"" was not good and didn't even come with the advertised aioli sauce. My fries sucked and were cold. How on Earth can you make a bad cheese steak? I don't even remember what they screwed up before that but I still remember the dissapointment coupled with a 70 dollar check.

We sat the table for 15 mins and neither of them brought a menu or said Hi to us. After I began staring at the girl wondering why we were being ignored, a white couple came in and sat at the bar. Within 30 seconds he had poured them waters and took their order. He made their drinks and we had yet to be greeted or brought a drink menu.

Seattle, WA","True to its name, this place serves up a mean sandwich! There are good restaurants, and then there are restaurants whose food is worthy of random cravings that could happen on any day at any time. Mean sandwich falls squarely in the latter category for me.
The Midnight At the Oasis, the falafel-based sandwich, is one of the best vegan sandwiches I've had anywhere. It simply can't be beet ;)
The chicken cutlet sandwich is SO delicious - it's the one I crave the most when I think of Mean Sandwich.
I've also had one bite of my friend's fish sandwich, which I found to be tasty with inventive flavors.
I'm not a huge fan of the potato skins and ins - I find them to be too crisp and browned for my tastes, but that won't keep me from coming back for the sandwiches (I do wish they offered an additional side dish option or two, though)!",,,

San Francisco, CA","We snuck into Mean Sandwich just before they were going to close for Thanksgiving week. So lucky us. Unluckily they were doing a fried chicken pop-up that same day and it was bonkers inside with lots of people and orders backed up in the kitchen. They did offer to send our food to the brewery next door if we chose to wait there instead but we decided to walk around the neighborhood and come back.
We ordered the steak tartare club and a side of salt and pepper 'skins and ins. It took about 35 minutes for our food. The steak tartare is labor intensive so due to the rush they were batching them as orders came in I think.
Worth it though! What an incredible idea to substitute steak tartare in spicy yuzu mayo for the T in the BLT. And with chewy dense rye bread. The sandwich doesn't look like much but I recommend sharing if you want to include a generous helping of skins as well.
Speaking of which, why has no one else thought about deep frying potato skins? Wonderfully salty, peppery, crispy with yummy soft potato insides. Dangerously addictive and filling. Goes great with beer :-).
Definitely want to come back and try the Midnight at the Oasis next time we're in town.",,,

The burger here is smashed to perfection with very crispy sides and juicy throughout. I'm not a fan of mustard or raw onions on a burger but boy, do they go well with this burger at Mean Sandwich. I'm a fan!
The ""fries"" are not really fries but fried potatoes with skin. I suspect they're baked first and then fried later: Whatever they do with them, they're quite magical :) Crispy skins with the meaty center in that spud.
If you've been to any Fredy's Steakhouse chain location, this is an elevated version of that kind of a burger.

San Diego, CA","Case of ordering wrong? Not sure. We actually made a u-turn to hit up this place to grab some lunch to go for our road trip up north. I always trust a local fav from yelp and the amount of patrons waiting for food further supported that. However, the combination of super long wait, high price and lackluster sandwiches have left me feeling a bit bitter abouts things.
I ordered the Buon Appetito (chicken cutlet sandwich) and the Jersey Sub (Italian sub) which are both $12. I thought it would be a quick process but the shop is small and it was very busy with orders going one at a time. It seemed like there was a combo of 4 or 5 people in the place ahead of me and who knows how many remote ordering. Pro tip (apparently) order ahead for pickup. I think my wait for 2 sandwiches was at least 25 mins.
Out of the 2, the Buon appetito was better, but still mediocre. But the Jersey was just plain bad. Whatever sub roll bread is used tasted like cheap white bread and was probably the primary reason it tasted badly... bread is important. It was just really plain tasting. I hate feeling so strongly on this but for nearly $30 for 2 sandwiches and being in a hurry, this visit was a big mistake and I should have just gotten sandwiches at Safeway for half the price.",,,

Initially we were going to go to the brewery next door after ordering sandwiches, but they were closed that day. Turns out that was OK, because we still got good beer with our sandwiches. The po'boy was slightly spicy, which I thought was delicious. It was a generous size, so I left feeling satisfied and refreshed. The space isn't exactly what I'd call ""comfortable,"" but that's OK because I was focused on the FOOD. Plus, they had puppy videos playing on the large TV in the corner.

Seattle, WA","Spent the afternoon with a friend who suggested we come here for lunch. She told me she had been here before and that I would like it; she was spot on.
Mean Sandwich is a small shop in Ballard that has no frills. Featured in Bon Appetit's 2017 List of America's Best New Restaurants, which I was informed about by my friend, I was intrigued to find a pretty basic menu: 7 sandwiches with 3 daily specials (soup may be one), 1 salad, 3 kinds of fat potato skins: salt & pepper or buffalo sauce or loaded-cheese/chives/bacon bits/more cheese, and yesterday's bun bread pudding.
While my friend and I were staring at the menu trying to decide what to order, a member of BOH came out, started singing loudly along with the 80's song playing and a huge grin. ""What should I get?!"" belted out my friend. ""Buon Appetito,"" he replied. She gushed. He kept singing. She informed me I had to get the skins and share them with her, so we got the salt and pepper.
Buon Appetito is a chicken sandwich with buffalo mayo, provolone, tomato, lettuce, and a pickled pepper relish. It looked huge. It was. My bud ended up taking half the sandwich home for later.
I got the Jersey Sub: capicola, provolone, salami, ham, lettuce, tomato, oregano, oil & vinegar (I asked for no red onion). Amazingly good. Crazy filling. The BREAD, man, the bread. It was like home, only a home I've never had.
Their icon is a pair of lady's lips with red lipstick, and they had free stickers. We each grabbed one. I slapped mine on the back of my day planner which is now in the recycling bin somewhere, and I really, really want to go back and get another sticker. And a sandwich.
You can get delivery. You can get catering. Adult beverages are available. I stuck with a bottle of root beer.
Outdoor seating where your pooch can also sit is available. Tables indoors along with bar stools facing the windows.

Example of poor ratio: is The Fish is really good when you get the right bite and you get a bit of everything. However the sardines are like 10% of the sandwich. The bread is like 40% the sandwich and at times your just eating bread, which is also really good but I want something in between it. Also the fish is between. The lettuce and the slaw so one bite and half of the fish slides right out the back. Next, thing you know your eating a vegan sandwich of slaw and lettuce.",,,

We came based on the rumors of a delicious sandwich and were not disappointed. The Mean Corned Beef was awesome. A great version of a staple, including mint to add a touch of sweet flavor. The potato sides were also awesome. The part I really want to highlight though is Dan. When I asked what he recommended, he actually asked questions and gave great guidance. He also checked in on us to see if we were enjoying our sandwiches and asked what we thought of our selections. On our way out the door he thanked us for visiting.

Seattle, WA","Mean Sandwich is a high quality sandwich place in the south end of Seattle's Ballard. It serves a limited range of well-produced sandwiches.
The restaurant is in an easy location to reach near the bridge. Parking nearby is limited and we were lucky to find a space in relatively short walking distance. We had come for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy.
Inside there is a very limited set of seating. This is a place that probably works best for takeout, since I wouldn't have felt really confident we could sit down, and don't want to let my food get cold. Service was counter-style, and friendly.
The menu is very limited. I knew this going in, but when faced with the actual choices, there are really only two that appeal to me much and really only one I definitely want.
There is a very appealing sounding side (fried potato lumps called skins and ins). This is exactly the sort of thing I typically love, but it was a bit overcooked and oversalted and I liked it but didn't love it, which was the big disappointment of the visit. I had expected this to be the high point.
When the sandwich arrived, it was great quality. I had a Buon Appetito (chicken). The bread is super - which I think is what tends to be most important. Not too sweet or soft. Great bread. The filling was a bit less exciting. It tasted like pretty normal sandwich fare. Not bad in any way, but not amazing. The portions were giant. With the skins, both of us had about twice as much food as we needed for a lunch and should have shared (except that we wanted completely different things).
Overall, this is a pretty good sandwich place. Much better than most of the regular chains or local places. If something from their tiny selection appeals to you, I recommend a visit. I doubt we'll be going very often, because we didn't bond with the choices we made and there isn't much more we want to try.",,,

The inside is dark, romantic, and they've got a tonnnn of cool drinks. Service was kind and quick as well.
Tried the Mai Tai and the Kingston Club (I think that's what it was called) and both were delicious and strong. We tried the artichoke fritters for a light bite and I was not a fan. They were way too doughy for my liking and all together didn't have a ton of flavor.
Definitely would come back to try more cocktails and more of the menu, because it sounds like they do have some really tasty options!",,,

YOU MUST TRY THE LAMB BENEDICT! I didn't think lamb and Benedict went together, till I tried it here and I fell in love! It's awesome! I will definitely go back for that!
The veg hash was great too! The veggies they used were fresh and wholesome! The eggs are cooked to perfection!
Gave it one less stars because the English breakfast tea quality was far below average! The coffee to was just ok, nothing great!",,,

Seattle, WA","Corvus had been a favorite for drinks, food, and brunch. Reasonably priced, friendly service, and decent acoustics made this a quiet standout. But the last few times have been disappointing, and last night brought back an old gripe about the new waitstaff that has landed in the Puget Sound area: they aren't professional. We arrived in time for happy hour, and ordered food from it. We also ordered two cocktails -- the menu said ""ALL COCKTAILS $2 OFF."" The toddy was ok, a little heavy-handed with the dried spices, and the Last Word was unbalanced, with too much sour competing with the Luxardo and both overwhelming the chartreuse. I could have sent it back, but wasn't in the mood to be ""that guy."" Food was fine as always, especially the fried okra and chickpeas.
When the the bill arrived, it showed the HH for happy hour pricing, but not on the Last Word. I pointed out the wording on the menu, and the waitress told me she only works one night a week and to take it up with the management/owner. No further help from her. Her service was basic, nothing stellar, but that last comment showed how little she cared about customers and the restaurant. Typically I would have sought out management and voiced my concerns, but last night I just wanted to get on with my evening.
It is a small matter, but I hope management clarifies their drink policy or gives staff the ability to make things right.",,,

The menu is pretty extensive, so I ended up asking the server for a recommendation. I'm really not a huge fan of gin based drinks, but she assured me that the gin they use is very smooth and doesn't have an overpowering flavor. And she was right! My drink was fruity and very refreshing. I'll be back to try more!",,,

My group got a variety of drinks and I was very impressed to say the least. There were definitely a few cocktails I'd love to try and I was very satisfied with what I got.

Redmond, WA","I've only been here for Sunday brunch with friends, so that is what I'm reviewing. I've been here a few times (but only started doing the check-in thing recently), and I've usually ordered the French toast. It's good stuff.
Yesterday, it seems that other customers thought the French toast was such good stuff that it was all gone by the time I arrived, just after 1 pm. The server suggested ""Australian unicorn toast"" as a substitute; it's the special of the day because it was the Australian bartender's birthday. It was a slice of thick toast, sliced diagonally, and served with whipped butter and syrup - pretty much the way French toast would be served, except without the egg batter coating. The portion size was too small, but it was only $3, so I ordered another portion. That was about right, and my tab ended up smaller than usual.
Service has generally been good.
The decor is nice, with a lot of cool art - though strangely (given the place's name) there's only a small picture of a crow on one wall, and a giant picture of an owl on the long wall opposite the bar.
We were seated close to the front door on a cold day, but it didn't feel drafty. I'm not sure how they manage that, but they're doing something right.",,,

While the pizza has never disappointed, unfortunately, perhaps their customer service has. Ordered a Large Soprano's Special (always a fave), Caesar Salad, and (because they were offering a special- see attached photo for a ""free small cheese pizza with purchase of a Large or Extra-Large pizza"") a small cheese pizza for the kids. I placed the order over the phone for take-out and sent the hubbs to pick it up. I heard the gal say $38-something, which seemed about right with taxes. Told the hubbs what the cost should be, and he came back saying it was almost $50 when he paid.
Listen, if you're going to offer a Special on your website, you should honor it, or at least put a caveat stating you need to mention the ad to get the deal. While Soprano's has some of the better pizza in the area, when we ordered from Pagliacci's (a little farther away), they automatically offered their Pi(e) Day special over the phone, without me needing to bring it up.

We have gotten to know the owners and staff and they are always asking for feedback. They care about their customers and work very hard.
The only improvement I would suggest someday is if there is a way to muffle the noise of conversation. But that is a good sign that their customers are so happy and comfortable that the animation carries through the place when it is busy.

Seattle, WA","Their brunch menu sounded so good, so came here hungry on a Sunday morning. First, I really liked the interior and the seating arrangements. I had read the reviews before and knew it was a slower paced restaurant. So I came prepared with The NY Times.
There were about four or five other tables, so it was pretty slow there. My server was prompt and helpful.
I ordered a crab frittata and beignets. Opened the paper and started to read. The beignets came out after 20 minutes. They were good and I was hungry. They came with a berry sauce that made them a lot better.
But you don't want to fill up on doughnuts or you get that sickish feeling of being hungry and full at the same time. So, waited for my frittata.
It was another half hour before my food came. I'm almost finished reading the paper and reduced to reading sections of the paper I never read. And, starving. I wish I would have been checked on, to give me an idea of the status of my order. In a fairly empty restaurant, an hour wait for breakfast food seems too long.
The crab frittata here came in a cute cast iron skillet. But a cast iron skillet when I cook, is to impair a nice crust on the food. This cast iron skillet rendered the frittata into a brown scorched mass. When I saw that it was overheated, I tried to immediately scrape it all out of this pan, to stop the cooking process and see if I could save it. No, the entire sides of the egg had formed a stubborn hard crust on the pan. I almost wanted to cry with disappointment. I so wanted to eat that frittata. But even in my hungry state it was inedible. My server offered to have the kitchen make another one, but I can't wait another hour.
The frittata came with a nice fruit salad, including blueberries. But please take off those little brown stem parts off the top of the blueberries. It makes me think they were not washed, as you would notice the brown tops.
Came hungry. Waited an hour. Food very over cooked. Left hungry. This equals a sad experience.",,,

Walking in, the place is a little dated and dark....a little update remodel would do some good? The seating accommodations were good considering we where a pretty large party but access was limited so if you needed to get up be mindful of where you choose to sit.
Menu was good, I had checked it out before we came to have an idea of what to order and looked at reviews etc. As the food came out most was ok, not as great as what I expected and the portions are on the smaller side.

One gentlemen told me that its his favorite spot with his gf, and that they visit at least 3 times a month. Another couple who were waiting as well, told me that its their tradition to sit by the mirror located at the corner. Regulars here, seems to have special traditions and stories with their loved ones. Before even entering, I felt a cozy vibe.
Ordered the Caesar salad, calamari, house-made fennel sausage pizza, and finally the butternut squash ravioli. All the foods came out at an prompt timing and all very delicious. Calamari was interesting because it had pieces of chick peas. Not complaining, just commenting. (Hehe)
Being one of the first to enter the restaurant, I was surprised to see how pack this place got middle of my dinner. This place almost seems under rated by yelpers and its almost like a secret!

Seattle, WA","Ordered via Slice:
Veggie somsa, beef fitchi
Quatro formaggi and meat lovers pizza - thin crust & small
Packaging was great, everything delivered well and warm!
Veggie somsa was nice! It was light yet decadent, but low on salt. We had happened to order a ranch dip so that def helped with the lack of salt.
Beef fitchi was juicy and heavy and appropriately salted. Loved it!
Four cheese pizza was nice, but since the cheeses used are blander - the pizza felt under seasoned and I definitely added some at home. A good size for one person, though! And the thin crust was easy to eat.
Meat lovers pizza was great, partner loved it!
I think next time we'll try the regular crust and I'll try a vegetarian pizza with saltier toppings :)",,,

Seattle, WA","What a pleasant surprise. I tried the Fitchi and it was even more heavenly than it looked. I'm not sure how they made this simple meat pie taste so good but it was fire. The pastry was light, flaky and browned on the outside, buttery and moist on the inside. It was almost like a soup dumpling in the sense that once you bit into it, there was just enough broth on the inside, along with the meat, to be quite delightful. I ordered this delivery so I can't speak to the service or environment but their delivery packaging was great. It's always a plus when your delivery doesn't arrive in a soggy bag dripping with what ever your ordered which sadly happens quite often from a lot of places. They are also open late which is always great! I'm excited to come back and try more from the menu. What a gem of a restaurant!",,,
Fitchi House,(206) 545-7499,"Tom M.
Seattle, WA","I'm a big fan of Central Asian culture, including its food, which in my experience falls more on the ""comfort food"" side of the spectrum that I inhabit than haute cuisine.
Despite being the center of the universe in the 15th century, the region is still largely unknown to the average American, so it came as a surprise to learn my wife was stopping by the new Fitchi House to bring home a few Turkmeni delicacies, including the eponymous house specialty the Fitchi, which the website describes as ""a take on Turkmen traditional dish Ishlekli (I艧lekli)"".
The Fitchi itself was delicious with a tasty meat filling (I suspect Vegans may be out of luck at the Fitchi House). The pastry was crispy and light. The filling also included quite a bit of broth that enhanced the taste but at the expense of serving as grab and go items - eat with a plate close at hand and a few napkins. We also had one Somsa, which we both found tasty; a distant cousin to the Samosas found on the other end of the Silk Road, I suspect. Perhaps it was this relationship that had me wishing for a little sauce to accompany it. The filling was similar to the Fitchi, however with a denser pastry shell, and it paired well. Still brothy and in need of that plate.
Fitchi House appears to be following the ""build the airplane as you fly it"" approach to their development process, so there were a few noticeable miscues: our 6 Fitchi/1 Somsa combo started out as a 3 and 3, and my wife left convinced she had agreed to a 4 and 2, but somehow we picked up a couple of Fitchis and lost a Somsa; a website that still pays a bit too much homage to Lorem ipso and needs some focused dev time; and potential brand confusion (the owner still manages the predecessor business, Milano Pizza, out of the location). I am also hopeful other fillings might be in the offing. As it is, there is a risk of the menu being a bit one note.
Nevertheless, it's hard to be too critical about a chance to eat this cuisine without the hassle of flying all the way to Ashgabat. Now all I need is a little kumis...",,,

I ordered a fitchi and somsa, I would have appreciated if owner had told me they were almost the same thing but with different shape, because they tasted the same . At first it looked good, then I opened and a lot of liquid came through it seems the filling was freezed or something. Bottom of the pastry was so soogy and almost raw dough in the bottom. No flavor at all. Really disappointed because the place is clean and it seems new and the owner has the best service ever.",,,

The owner is from Turkmenistan and a Fitchi is a traditional dish. It is like a pot pie crust and inside is a ground beef and onion filling. She gave us a banana pepper infused vinegar to add to it. I enjoyed it, but the hubby didn't.
The pizza was super good. The crust was tasty and not too thick. The toppings were fresh. We had chicken with Alfredo sauce and the chicken club. I would recommend both, but definitely try the chicken club. I haven't seen it at other places, but it is tasty!

The not so good: the place had a funny smell, ""like pizza and laundry detergent,"" as my sister described it. The cauliflower kale gnocchi wasn't great; I'm a fan of kale but the texture and flavor was just off here. Also, something about the overall vibe was lacking for me (it was a large open space that almost reminded me of a barbecue joint. Which...eh).
The medium: The gelato was a mix. We ordered the nutella (not great), the caramel (good flavor but ""icy/chunky"" texture), and the chocolate (the best one, very rich and creamy as gelato should be and very good).
The good: the pizza was clearly the best part. Mike is still raving about it. Good thin crust with good flavor. Also, the staff was friendly and the service efficient.",,,

Good dishes we had were the appetizer Burrata Pepperonata, and the entree Gnocchi with braised beef. I was a big fan of the marinara in the Gnocchi dish and the meat was very tender.
The Italian wedding soup was so bland, and it was $10. I feel like a can of Pregresso would have been much cheaper and better. Also, the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara to me tasted awful. My gf ordered it and said it was just okay, but when I tried it I found it quite bad.
The servers were friendly and helpful so can't fault them for that.

The desserts were not good at all. My special cake tasted burned and had tons of salt. cannoli was way too salty as well. Maybe we should have just tried the pizza since they are known for that.
Sadly I don't think we will be giving this place another shot. It was our anniversary dinner and my boyfriend wasn't too happy I picked this place - whoops!

Seattle, WA","We are fans of Tutta Bella and have visited most of the locations in the city. This location has a parking lot on site and also street parking when available.
The food is fresh and who doesn't love a good wood-fired pizza! I especially like that I can substitute goat cheese for mozzarella since I am allergic to cow's mill. The shakers of cheese also contain Pecorino Romano which is made with 100% sheep's milk so another win for me!
I love their beet salad packed with roasted beets, slivers of red onion, pistachios, and goat cheese tossed in a red wine vinaigrette. I usually go overboard with fresh ground black pepper but it's so good that way.
We've had a LOT of pizzas here over the years and some of them have included:
- Filomena with olive oil base, roasted asparagus, ham, caramelized onions, and goat cheese.
- Michele with pomodoro, Isernio's chicken sausage, Calabrian salami and chiles, smoked mozzarella di bufala, and fresh basil.
- Gioia with extra virgin olive oil, prosciutto di Parma, fresh eggs, fresh mozzarella, arugula, and shaved Parmigiano.
- Pietro with pomodoro, fresh mozzarella, salame, Isernio's Italian sausage, chili flake, and fresh basil.
- Capricciosa with pomodoro, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto cotto, artichoke, mushroom, kalamata, and fresh basil.
- Hazan with pomodoro, fresh mozzarella, Gorgonzola, provola, whole milk mozzarella, Calabrian salami, and mushroom.
- Margherita with pomodoro, fresh mozzarella, grana, basil, and extra virgin olive oil.
Their Napoli salad is one of my favourite salads with ribbons of romaine, chicken breast, salami, crumbled pancetta, tomato, carrot, artichoke, kalamata olive, gorgonzola, tossed in their house dressing. For an additional $5, you can also turn a regular size salad into a salad pizza served on pizza crust dough.
I've also had their Polpette (Neapolitan meatballs) and they were deliciously savory. The Saut茅 Di Vongole was also delicious: Manila clams, white wine, macerated tomato, chili flakes, and oregano. The clams also come with toasted house-made bread and make for an excellent sharing appetizer.
I'd recommend signing up for their email newsletter. You'll get a free dessert for your birthday (tiramisu, trust me) and know about seasonal pies when they arrive. Two of these examples include:
- Calabrese with EVOO, black mission figs, prosciutto di parma, goat cheese, rosemary, balsamic reduction.
- Capannina - extra virgin olive oil, fresh mozzarella, Meyer lemon, prosciutto di Parma, and Grana Padano.
Lunch is served during the week, M-F from 11:00 to 15:00 with the price range from $6 to $13. They also have a HH menu every day from 15:00 to 18:00 and again from 21:00 to close.
If you are averse to kids of any age, this location is frequented by a lot of families with young children. Some evenings when there are a LOT of diners, there is a cacophonous din inside from all the kids and adults and general bustle of the servers and kitchen.

Seattle, WA","We dined there for lunch on a Monday. Neapolitan pizza is my boyfriends favorite so I knew this was going to be a hit since they are certified from Naples as a legit pizzeria.
We were seated right away and had prompt service. After browsing their menu online prior to arriving I wanted the clam pasta but it turns out on their special menu there was a even more delicious sounding clam dish. That Monday they did not have clams. Very disappointing to have it on your menu and even more on your specials menu then can't serve it. I went with the bolognese, it was quite tasty.
My boyfriend had the Leonardo 10 inch lunch sized pizza. It was perfect. He likes it cooked longer so the crust is crisper and they happily delivered his request.
Service was great all the way through. Tentative, efficient, and friendly.
Tip: we used a ChinookBook coupon for $5.00 off and brought gift cards from Costco only $79 for $100 worth of value.
We will be back for sure. Great experience only 4 stars since they didn't have the two things I would have first order on the menu.",,,

Waipahu, HI","We really enjoyed Tutta Bella! I had read a few reviews and it looked like a definite stop if we were in the area. Well, it popped up when we were at the zoo as a place nearby.
Upon entering, I was a little nervous if it would actually be good. The restaurant was large so I wondered if it was just a large scale typical chain pizza joint... Wrong!
The chew of the crust was so delicious - not like the oily/heavy more American style pizzas. We tried the pizza was prosciutto and arugula. Next time I would want to try one with red sauce. We don't have many options like this in Hawaii, so it's a treat for us.
We also tried the nutella calzone ($10). It was good but I don't know if I'd get it again. The calzone outside was like the pizza, nice and chewy.
Service was friendly and fast (but not rushed). I would definitely come back if we are in the area again.

Wallingford, Seattle, WA","This restaurant has a good vibe, it is definitely a little bougie for a pizza restaurant, but in Wallingford, I shouldn't expect anything less. I didn't order their pizza, but my friends did and it looked pretty good, but this review is based off my of dish. I order their Bolognese and I had pretty high expectation since their pizza was known to be good and they're an Italian restaurant. The pasta tasted store bought and not fresh at all, along with their sauce it was not flavorful. Their had carrots in their sauce which was something I haven't had in a bolognese. Their portion was small and for $17.50, it was definitely not worth it. I should have ordered a pizza as it looked pretty good.
Our waiter was pretty awesome, he was hesitant on our 7 guest table outside, but it looked like he was okay with it and was able to meet all our needs and was super attentive in our drinks/water.",,,

The atmosphere itself is really cute, they have lights up and it's overall just a really nice vibe. They also have dough and wiki sticks for kids to play with.
They have several pizza options, which you can get as a 10"" more personal size or a larger 13"" size for sharing. Four adults and a kid got two 13"" and one 10"" and had plenty. They also have beer, wine and cocktails.
My girlfriend and I split a half cheese, half prosciutto e funghi (mushroom, mozzarella, prosciutto and basil). Once you pile on toppings it definitely becomes more of a fold it to eat it or use a fork and knife situation. It was good but again nothing really stood out to us.
Service was decent. I did sit with an empty water glass for awhile and other refills were a bit slow. Our waitress was nice but not around much.
Overall it's cute inside and has decent pizza.",,,

Petaluma, CA","The Roberto pizza was one of the best Neapolitan styled pizzas I've ever had. The combination of flavors and ingredients were unique but so harmonious. Both my boyfriend and I were taken back by how good it was, especially with an additional Parmesan and pepper flakes.
The burrata itself was good as well, but the pepper/olive tapenade it comes with was overpowering and weakened the dish overall. However, the butter soaked bread that came with it was deviously good on its own and with the cheese as well.
The Caesar salad was pretty good for it being a classic. However, the chicken was weirdly cut up and looked sparse - it was mostly romaine with not enough croutons and chicken.
The drinks were also good, Sorrento is a solid frou-frou drink and tasted really really good without the alcohol overpowered. Boyfriend had a blended red that was really light in flavor, but wasn't the worst.
Overall, we had a good experience. The service was a little lackluster but the restaurant itself wasn't too popping. We drove by on a Friday night and it definitely was busy so I'm sure it was just the night we went. They gave us a free dessert for the boy's bday which we got to choose - a nice perk.

The food was just a little above average, but a really good value since I shared garlic knots, lasagna, and a 13"" Roberto with two others for around $15 each.

Their Pizzas taste really similar to the Pizzas I got when I was in Napoli, some of the ingredients are different (non-napolitan) but many of them are the same. If you like wood-fired artisan Pizza, you will love this place.
I have ordered many different things through multiple visits and nothing has been disappointing. In fact, the plates are usually really good. The Neapolitan Lasagna is excellent; if you want one, make sure you get there early because they run out of them quickly. Also, try avoid common weekend hours, the place tends to get really busy. S

Cambridge, MA","Tutta Bella is really close to my house, so it was one of the first restaurants that I tried when I moved to Seattle. At first I thought it's going to be a super casual pizza place, like Mod Pizza or Blaze, but it is actually a much nicer restaurant than that. It's an upscale-casual place with an unassuming exterior. However, the interior is very well decorated (kind of like Maggiano's or similar restaurants) and it was bustling when I went on a Sunday evening around 8PM.
I chose to get takeout from the restaurant and I was in a pasta mood that night, so I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese. I waited about 15 minutes for them to prepare my meal, paid the $17 for the pasta, and went on my way home.
When I went home, I took out my pasta, and it was smaller than I expected. I was expecting $17 pasta to last at least more than a meal, but I was able to finish the whole thing in one sitting. This does say one thing about the pasta tho-- it was really good! The noodles were not soggy, and the sauce had a hint of sweetness on top of the normal tomato-y flavor. It made for a very filling (although very carb-y) meal.
Since I live close to here, I'd think I wanna come back and try their pizza some day (since that is what they are famous for!). However, I don't think I can afford to be a regular here because it is a bit too pricey for a fresh college grad like me. I would recommend this for special occasions though, like a birthday or a promotion.",,,

I went here once when I was broke. My expensive ass girlfriend insisted we go!! Good lord that price tag had me shaking in my boots. BUT!! Holy smokes the experience was crazy!! That crazy ass spaghet with the black little fish eggs on top!? What is that stuff?!?! The grilled octopus with hominy grits?!?! My lord it is fiirrreeee. Now I have more scratch so it's not as terrifying to go, but I will say my credit score has taken a dip since truly committing to this chick. The service is literally the best thing that ever happened. It's like being at your friends house who is your favorite friend and is the best host out of all your friends, but then they charge you $500 on the way out. I'm going here tonight and I can't flipping dipping wait!! Ohhhhh I bet the bottle we get is gonna sting lol. Oh!?!?! The architecture and decor is a dream. The exterior is very unassuming but once you're inside it looks like somewhere Don Draper would take his side chick. 10/10 would recommend.",,,

Edmonds, WA","I can't believe I haven't posted this as we go so often! We love everything about Cafe Juanita! They have wonderful staff and wonderful dishes with lovely presentation! I always want to applause the chefs as we leave and sometimes I do!!
Lately our favorites are:
1) Hearth bread 3 piece appetizer with 3 toppings (avocado w lime, hummus w garbanzo and pesto, and dElicious mushrooms)
2) Crab with granny apple sorbet in a dried butter crab ""dust"". It's like dipping wArm crab into warm butter but it's cold crab in cold crab flavored butter ""dust. We LOVE this!!! So unique!!
3) If they have the scallops we hhave go get them and I won't get them anywhere else ever! They are cooked to perfection and last night came with a pur茅ed parsnip, cippolinni onions, special blood orange segments, and o think arugula. Outstanding!!!!
4) their bread service is outstanding and they have wonderful items and a great variety for anyone.
5) my fave pasta right now is the tagliatelle with mushrooms and parmesan - the best anywhere!!
6) desserts are spectacular but our three faves are the chocolate sorbet which is super creamy like ice cream, the amazing panna cotta which has a honey from Spain below it, and the oil cake which is more like angel cake and currently served with a lemon sorbet and a pistachio ""cracker candy"" and pansies. Each is wonderful in its own rIght.
Just go! Treat yourself but save us a table!!!!

Kirkland, WA","Talk about an incredible dining experience! Cafe Juanita absolutely blew me away with the fabulous services and outstanding food. This is definitely a special occasion type of restaurant and a bit spendy, but well worth the price. I opted for the chef's tasting menu, which was $145/person. It was an additional $85/person with the wine pairing. In addition to the six courses, there was a bonus mini cocktail and appetizer at the beginning that were both delightful and full of flavor. I think what surprised me the most was the Alaskan King crab appetizer served with green apple sorbetto and crab butter powder. The combination of flavors was light and worked very well together.
The wine pairings and dishes came out at a good pace, so it was a little over a two-hour meal. Each wine paired very well with the dish served. I was also really impressed with the Tajarin with white sturgeon caviar (paired with Dom Perignon) dish. Even the variety of breads that were brough to the table before the meal were delicious and well crafted.
I love Cafe Juanita and can't wait to return!",,,

There seems to always be a lot of regulars here. I had perfectly cooked al dente pasta with spotted prawn (a special menu item). The lamb chops are excellent and a favorite dish. The meat is flavorful, slides off the bone, and melts in your mouth. We order this every time. I like the variety of the bread plate. The desserts are all light and perfect for an after dinner drink.

It was served over a sorbet. An interesting blend of flavors but have to admit, cld have done without the sorbet part. the other winning course was the angel hair pasta with caviar on top. So buttery and delicious! Main course was the lamb... good but nothing incredibly memorable. Service was excellent, they even brought us some celebratory champagne to end off meal!

My favorite dish was the Pasta Special. That night, the special was a Parpadelle with Alaskan Prawns. It was delicious with a great chew on the pasta. I hope to be back when that is the pasta special again.
The Pork Cheeks were tender and rich. The rabbit had great flavor. The birthday Affogato was very good. My husband really loved the Bayleef Gelato. It was really unique and fun.

The location is off of a side road and at night, you could blink and miss it. But don't let that fool you, the interior is beautiful and cozy.
If it's your first time here, I strongly recommend the Chefs Tasting Menu and add on the grilled octopus!
And if you're in the mood grab a bottle of wine. We ordered a Barbera that we absolutely enjoyed.
On top of great food, the service staff were friendly and we talked with our server not just about the menu but about other spots we love to eat at in the Seattle area!

Cleveland, OH","This is a well-oiled machine of a restaurant. Effortless valet, pleasant greeter, quietly effective servers and an interior that promotes repast. It is clear why this place carries the reputation it does.
I enjoyed my octopus appetizer. When the waiter stated it was the most tender he'd ever had, I was skeptical. After a bit, without the familiar spring, I didn't know if I liked it. As I mixed it with the verde and hummus it certainly won me over. Similarly, I was skeptical of the quince on the Iberico Pork Cheeks. I was worried about too much sweetness. After the first bite I judiciously rationed out the fruit so a small piece accompanied every bite of the rich and tender meat. Can Panna Cotta be too smooth. I was promised one of the smoothest varieties available and again, the waiter was right. Rich and creamy with a tad of salt and pepper (?) mad it a joy.
I'm many spots, a meal this good comes with effort, by my kitchen-view seat afforded me a look at a quiet and efficient workspace. Relax, you're at Cafe Juanita. Breath.",,,

While their menu changes, there are a few mainstays like the foie gras and rabbit. But they do tweak it based on what's seasonable & available. For this particular visit my favorite dishes were the fish of the day (black cod) and the foie gras. They both featured fall/winter ingredients and warm spices. It captured that the essence of sweater weather season without tasting like PSL.
Lastly a huge kudos to the staff. Services was attentive, knowledgeable but not overbearing. You don't feel like they're breathing over your shoulder or judging your wine choices.",,,

They had a tasting menu, and an a la carte menu and we decided to go with the a la carte menu. I got a Sorelle Bronca extra brut Prosecco, that comes with 30 month aged Parmigiano-Reggiano, and we got Tajarin sage butter and Ravioli della sera.
Parmigiano-Reggiano paired with Prosecco was a great combo, and a good start to the meal. The Tajarin sage butter was delicious, but the ravioli was the highlight of this course and our meal. It was a beetroot and cheese ravioli, shaped like candies that looked like works of art. They looked so good and tasted much better.
For our next course, we got Guinea fowl and Anderson Valley lamb rack 'Scottadita'. We liked both of our dishes, enjoyed it a lot.
We finished our meal with panna cotta and chocolate gelato. The panna cotta was delicious, loved addition of honey on top of it.

Marysville, WA","What a nice place! Heard they remodeled and the inside looks modern and sleek. Very dark and romantic setting, but here I am with my friend from college. We are foodies. We adventured around all over Washington together.
This place was my friends choice tonight. She was amazed with the food at the first time with her husband and has been eating to try out again.
The all valley parking was a surprise.$8 guess reasonable considering this is $$$$ restaurant. The server was extremely knowledgeable and nice, focused on serving one table at a time. No rush and go type of service. She answered all our questions with lots of details. When I first looked at the menu, I could not imagine what kind of dish each would be. Lots of ??? What's tajarin? Fowl? Escarole??? Well you have an expert to ask, she gives you suggestions and nicely help you out without intimidating you.
We ordered citrus salad, octopus and crab appetizer, sage butter tajarin, white sauce tajarin with caviar, squid ink pasta with prawns, rissotto, veal and gelato.And yes it was too much! But my friend has an experience here that the dishes are quite small. We were hungry so we ordered to comfort our tummy. Ended up taking some veal meat back home.
The dishes are excellent! Everything has exquisite details, the presentation was pretty, the sauces were just right in flavor. I can't tell what they use for the sauces, they are mixture of things I can't create, which is what I look for when eating out cause who wants to eat something you can cook at home? Our favorites have to be the risotto and the squid ink pasta. They are heavenly. If I have a chance to go back, those are the 2 I'd order again. Earl gray gelato was excellent too. I used to like molly moons earl gray ice cream which the flavor going downhill nowadays. CF's gelato I feel is a lighter version of that.
The price probably is the only one I'd deduct the star from. It could have been less? I mean 5 oz Miyazaki steak is $120. The veal we had was $75 though it was a pretty good portion. I'd come a lot more often if the price is better.",,,

The interior of Cafe Juanita is classily decorated, and the entire edge of the restaurant has continuous windows that somehow give a great view even though the restaurant is tucked between condo complexes. The wait staff is attentive and nice, but not overly stuffy. The atmosphere is relaxed for an enjoyable dinner rather than restrictive as some icier restaurants can be.
I've tried several small plates and main dishes. I enjoyed them all, even the ones I wasn't excited for but someone else at the table ordered.

Seattle, WA","Amazing Italian dishes, we tried the mushroom Lasagna and Meat ball bucatini. We wanted to try the bucatini with the classic bolognese sauce but they didn't have it yet, but the meat ball sauce was definitely on point, on a sour side but the more you eat, the addictive it gets. However, the main star was the lasagna. it is the best I've tried so far, they didn't have the classic lasagna on the day either but I was so glad the waitress convinced us the mushroom sauce was really amazing. It really was, like the moment you took a first bite, you know this sh*t was better than any lasagna I tried in Italy, creamy, yet powerful taste.
The missing start is the bucatini itself, it wasn't al dente, more like undercooked, which disappointed me a little bit, and the step prices like other mentioned in the previous reviews, I was a quite shocked when my bill came closer to 40$ , considering the size and the self service.
Anyway, good lunch spot, amazing Italian dishes, and the waitress was super nice and attentive when I asked for a hot sauce, she offered me a free little bottle of their house special chili oil.

But a home unlike any other, this is a home with a framed photo of Sophia Lauren, homemade pastas lining the counter, and a beautiful decadent white and blue tiled wood burning oven. Every detail is absolutely perfect.

Shoreline, WA","Literally saving the best post for last from my recent spontaneous 3 day birthday weekend. This Yelp post was for a first time visit to Via Rosa 11 on 6/9/18.
I knew absolutely nothing about this Rolling Bay restaurant, except that local resident and avid Yelper George S. mentioned takeout lasagne. I'm probably am the biggest Italian cuisine fan, but never travelled there. Yet.
After stops at nearby Bay Hay and Feed and the newbie wine tasting at Rolling Bay Winery, it was time to have some lunch. What a phenomenal culinary find ! Via Rosa 11 functions both as an Italian retail market and restaurant.
The counter staff are friendly and patient with newcomers who have to ponder the vast choices. I kid you not, it was tough. Plus the servings are generous, a challenge since I was dining solo.
There are daily specials, salads, soups, antipasti, panini, pizza, pasta including ravioli, lasagne, gnocchi, crostini, desserts, ad naseum.
I can't imagine someone not finding something fantastic to enjoy.
For Seattleites, it's like a mashup of Il Corvo, Pasta and Co., Delaurenti's, and PFI, but scaled down. It also exudes a tight community vibe, a lovely open food prep/ kitchen area, plus a wood fired oven.
I ended up ordering the Burrata salad ($12) with arugula, burrata, cherry or grape tomatoes, olives, pickled onion, baby peppers, radish all nicely dressed in balsamic, plus opted for two (not four) crostini. Next time there is polpo/octopus salad....
Plus who could resist fresh pasta cooked to order with your choice of sauce ($13)? This handmade pasta aficionado selected paparadelle with bolognese. Lovely presentation...tasted wonderful on 6/9 and even when microwaved at work today on 6/13. That's quality goodness!
Lots of beverage choices too, but the iced lemon water was a nice touch.
While I was texting back and forth with George S. via Yelp, I paused and asked the gentleman weaving between tables whether he was Pino, the restaurant owner.
Indeed he was and he regaled me with vivid stories of growing up eating fresh, seasonal, coastal food from Imperia in the Liguria region. He even showed me pictures and postcards off the kitchen wall. Family anecdotes and inspirations are the best!
He said he never goes to ""work""...truly this is a genuine individual who loves what he does and wants to share that with you. He is living the dream!
When he realized that I visited here on a whim for my birthday, he kindly gave me free cannoli. Mmmmm, so tasty. I'll have to be prepared next time have a cooler and order the pan of tiramisu.
As I'm busing my table (the entire place was filling up with customers amid the kitchen bustling kitchen activity), I was called over to see one of the culinary staff pull out large porchettas from the oven. I can only imagine that sliced thin in a panini sandwich or an open faced ciabatta.
Yes, I ventured in and dined alone at Via Rosa 11. But the welcoming atmosphere and delicious cuisine made me feel like a Bainbridge Island regular on a whirlwind field trip to Liguria.
Grazie mille, Chef Pino and of course, George S.",,,

I think my husband was a little more enamored than I was and would've rated a four.

Mountain View, CA","This is a charming, unsuspecting, casual Italian restaurant tucked away from on Bainbridge Island, even away from downtown Bainbridge Island.
The 5 of us ordered:
-Pizza of the day with prosciutto and burrata: voted as the best dish of the meal by the fiance. The crust is very well done and made in the wood fired oven.
-Mushroom pappardelle: my favorite dish of the meal. They put so much mushroom in there and the pappardelle is so fresh.
-Buratta salad: my dad's favorite. You get a very generous serving of buratta with the house salad.
-Side of cauliflower: a good side. Not a standout but good to get some vegetables in.
-Seafood on squid ink linguine: this was the first dish I chose but we all agreed they dropped the ball a bit. The linguine was way too soft and the dish overall was a bit salty.
All in all, we really enjoyed our meal here. We'd definitely come back but will skip the seafood linguine next time.",,,

Bainbridge Island, WA","My mom and stepdad live in southern Italy (Capitello, Salerno) for eight months out of the year. I've been to Italy plenty of times. They have a traditional, outdoor stone pizza oven at their Italy home. My stepdad has been making pizza since he was a teenager, usually from scratch, where 'scratch' means 'the sauce is made from tomatoes and herbs he grew himself.'
We are tough customers when it comes to fresh-made pasta and brick-oven pizza.
So much so, in fact, that when they're in the US they usually avoid Italian food -- not just because it's usually too Americanized for their tastes, but because they will freely tell you they're kind of sick of it at that point, and sorta want a cheeseburger and a salad with ranch dressing.
My mother has actually suggested of her own accord when visiting me that we go to Via Rosa 11, which should tell you all you need to know.
The pizzas are thin-crust and a great size for one very hungry person, with potential for leftovers if you're not ravenous. *They also offer burrata.* I've never asked them if it's actual bufala, but it's so tender that it hasn't mattered to me enough to ask. On nights when I feel like splurging on comfort food, I pick up some fresh-made noodles and a container of one of their sauces -- bolognese is a personal favorite, and theirs never lets me down (get the wild boar bolognese if you're feeling especially fancy). I've bought a container of their meatballs in sauce and just eaten those for a meal with a salad. I enjoyed the meatball sub I had, but I can't speak as to the rest of the sandwiches, because when I'm there I'm not usually wanting sandwiches!
The only 'downsides':
1 - Limited seating. If they're slammed, that might present a challenge.
2 - The location means that I didn't learn about this spot until long after I wish I had known it existed, in spite of frequenting the feed store...and I imagine there are other people out there who haven't discovered it yet, either.
It's worth a trip. If you can swing it to hit Bay Hay & Feed and Via Rosa 11 on the same day, I personally think that those two locations alone are worth a trip all the way from Seattle and beyond.",,,

It's kind of outdoorsy with tables and benches outside for you to sit. The best time to eat is lunch or late lunch, because in the evening, the flies start coming around.

Seattle, WA","This review is about the availability/communication between the restaurant and its customers. We ordered on Sunday, April 12th (Easter) via GrubHub.com. The order and even the adjusted pick-up time was approved. We got to the restaurant to pick up the pizzas and it appeared to be closed. Thinking maybe they just were working in the back, and only came to the front when the pizza was ready, I thought I'd call to check. I heard the phone ringing in the restaurant and no one picked up. As we were a little early, we waited 15 minutes just in case they were in the back finishing up the order. So, it was 7:15 on a Sunday night, and there was no indication from either the restaurant's website, Facebook, or GrubHub that they would be closed. We ended up getting pizza at Pagliacci's across the street. I am disappointed that we went through the entire hassle of trying to order at Credo.",,,

They have the Guy Fieri symbol out front on their window so I was thinking ""this really must be the best pizza in West Seattle!""- and west seattle has a ton of pizza, but I think I had too high of expectations. I mean it was good, but was it the best? I don't think so.
We did a half mushroom half veggie pizza. It came out fairly quickly considering there was only one guy doing the pizzas. It's cool you can see him make them and use the fire oven and everything. It was like $18 which is a little steep for me considering we easily could have each gotten a pizza for ourselves but I understand.

The pizzas were delicious, we got the Margherita ($13.95) and the Parma Con Uovo ($17.95). The pizza crust was perfect coming out of their oven and a pretty good size. The four of us were filled up after two slices of pizza and some pasta and splitting a rather large Caesar salad, which was also fantastic.

But... It's a pizzeria right?? So with that my friend and I split the Caprese Salad, Carne con Uovo (egg on her side), as well the Spaghetti Carbonara. Everything was excellent. And although the pasta sauce is thickened with egg, it was the star of the night.

Seattle, WA","4th review update, 12/26/19: Better than ever !
Do you think the perfect Italian dish exists? Well it does, here at Credo. I was a little apprehensive at the new menu but holy flying meatballs Jacques has knocked it out of the PARK!! Try the chicken sous vide, it is perfect. It comes with a small side salad and pasta on the same plate, which I questioned until I took a bite of the chicken and realized I wanted a salad too, which had been pre provided. It is absolutely perfectly balanced. The chicken melts in your mouthThis dish is pure culinary genius! No wonder Guy Fieri couldn't stop eating it!i told him to start charging more, because it rivals the best high end Italian (Scarpetta in Las Vegas) I've ever eaten and maybe even surpasses it. Next time this man opens a restaurant it will be in New York and $100+ a plate.
2nd review update: This place has been PACKED since Guy Fieri came here!! Finally getting the attention it deserves, I'm so proud to have this place right in my back yard! Jacques, the owner, is amazing and his drinks and drink recommendations cannot be beat. The cinqo fromaggio is a must try pizza, as well as the Biancoverde.
A tip for all ya lovers of Italian meats - prosciutto can be added to both options above to make an amazingly savory and delicious pizza. Hats off to the new pizza chef, I didn't think this place could get any better, but it has. Pasta dishes I'd recommend especially are the Gnocchi Vodka al a verde, and the linguine Alfredo 谩 la Sophia. My favorite salad here is the Credo Salad - with a unique and refreshing mix of apple, feta and walnuts in amongst the greens it is a must try. My mother prefers the Spring Green Mix, but both are incredible!
Update: Alright, I have to update my review and if I could I would give this place another star yet.
Tonight I had no idea what I wanted to drink and asked for a cocktail recommendation- the waitress sent over Jacques, the owner. He asked what I was in the mood for (something semi sweet and sparkly) and came back with a newly invented cocktail. It was amazing and I had to keep the rest of my table from stealing it after they took a sip. This is the second time he's invented a cocktail on the spot for me and it's been AMAZING. And I'm picky with my drinks! P.S. they're still the best pizza in Seattle. Seriously.
Original review:
Still the best pizza in West Seattle! I've been coming here since it opened. Their drinks are amazing, and the owner told us he used to be a professional bartender after I complimented him on how good they were!
The blueberry mojhito is my favorite signature drink of theirs in season and the Credo cosmo is also delicious.
My favorites here for food are the gnocchi, bianoverde pizza with added prosciutto and the Credo Salad. Their salads are really unique and taste amazing.",,,

Seattle, WA","Oh my, was looking for a place to get a late dinner and ended up here.
Cute little place on California. I'm real glad I decided to try it.
Not the largest menu but they do offer some pastas. But I came for the wood fired pizza and I wasn't disappointed.
I started with a ceasar salad that was pretty good..the only thing I would add to this would be anchovies, but that's just me.
I ordered the suggested ""meat style"" pie. Plenty of toppings but the star of the show was the crust. This is the crust I love, thinner, hold up well but still has a bit of crunch.
I will say that there was a peculiar flavor (I think from their sausage) that I couldn't really get my head around but it didn't take away from one of the best pizza's I've had since moving to WS. I believe it was the chorizo which in my opinion this pizza didn't need.
Bravo... I'd hit this place anytime.",,,

The place is somewhat a smaller space but we had no trouble getting a table right away on a Saturday night. The service was a little slow as it looked like one server was running up and down the restaurant. We ordered the Margherita pizza and the linguine Alfredo with a bottle of the house wine. I did realize we ordered basic dishes but they didn't blow me away. If you cook a simple and straightforward dish then it should be done well, or add a twist that is original.

Of course the porchetta is delicious, but so is the meatball, and so is the pasta, and so is the salami. How I manage to choose, I don't even know! The prices run about $10-13ish and it is SO worth it.
The pricing for their sliced salami is a little cheaper here than at other stores. But the game changer is the amazing deal on their guanciale ($15/lb). I use that on every pasta sauce I make and the flavor is out of this world!!!",,,

The ""Salumi cured meats + cheese and olives"" was a bit underwhelming. I was expecting a variety of cured meats, like salame, prosciutto, speck, bologna, etc., like I would get in italy, but instead it was only a few types of salame. Then I got the porchetta sandwich, which was more like a pulled pork, porchetta is usually sliced. Also, too much pork for my taste, overdoing quantity is not always good.

I got the October special that came with meats, grilled onions (extra?), cheese, and grilled apples which was such a unique touch. It cost approximately $14.
My friend got the porchetta which is their recommended hot sandwich. Both were delicious. The meat in the porchetta was nicely ground and seasoned. My sandwich meat was a bit on the salty side but the apple was an amazing touch.
Things to note: fast service, bus your own tables. Water available, clean shared bathrooms with the building, they have a code.

Seattle, WA","Does a restaurant with 1.3K reviews and an average rating of 4.5 really need another review? No. Nonetheless I'm writing this because this place was just THAT good.
I ordered the Porchetta sandwich. When I initially ordered and the bill came out to $12, I thought ""that's a lot just for a sandwich."" But like what other reviewers have said, the sandwich is just massive. Pictures don't really capture its size well. In terms of portions, it felt equivalent to eating a chipotle burrito bowl or 2/3lb patty burger. I was stuffed, and I'm a big eater.
Quantity, check.
Quality? Double check!
My first bite really surprised me. Not just because how delicious it was but how hot (temperature-wise) the meat was. It was emitting steam as I ate it. Much better than toasted or reheated meat at most places. The pork is freshly braised and it makes a different not just with its temperature but also the texture. It's so tender and juicy. And again, there's just so much of it!
To name a few other standout parts of the sandwich.
- The bread is nice and airy. A bit of a crunch on the outside and soft on the inside.
- The garlic/oil spread on the sandwich is just so well done. Very strong garlicy flavor without overwhelming the other ingredients.
If I had to nitpick at all, I'd say the vegetables were just okay. Especially the onions which had great carmelized flavor but texture-wise was pretty mushy. This is why I'd give a slight edge to Un Bien as Seattle's best sandwich

However, the meat is juicy, tender and really good. The bread they use works really well as it was able to absorb the juice from the meat. For $12, it's a really good deal!!!

Came here an hour before closing so I was able to avoid the long lines. Luckily, the person at the register was extremely nice and helpful and explained how they cure all meats in house and just about everything is delicious. Apparently the porchetta sandwich is the most popular sandwich and I purchased a sampler of 4 cured meats on the side to try because of the namesake...nothing disappointed at all.

After a year of knowing of this place's existence yet being unable to find a good reason to be in Pioneer Square on a weekday, I was finally able to sneak over now that they're open on Saturdays--and I was not disappointed!
Since I was with a few other friends, we ordered the meat, cheese, and olive platter (yum), the seasonal sandwich (potentially the best sandwich in Seattle), and a side of porchetta (can't miss). Everything was amazing. Even the Olive and Mole salumis, which, I'll admit, I had my doubts.

They have plenty of seating indoor and also outdoors. I recently ordered their Salumi salami. I had ordered it to go and warmed. The cashier told me it would take a few minutes longer since I asked for it warm which I was completely ok with. I am a very patient person and saw that everyone was getting their order before me. About 15 minutes passed and I was still waiting for my order.
People went and came and my order did not. Then one of the staff making the food asked me if I was waiting for and order and I told him yes. He apologized for the delay and said it was unacceptable. He immediately told me he would give me a refund for my order. I was not upset at all as I know that everyone makes mistake especially when you are really busy.

Mioposto is one of the better reviewed pizza offerings through Caviar, and I'm always game for a Margherita pizza. The pizza that I received was just okay, but didn't make me feel the $14.95 price matched the quality or the size.
The pizza was more dough than pizza (even distribution of sauce, cheese, and dough). For being wood fired, the pizza felt pretty soggy (I put it in the oven for a 2nd cooking just in case, after trying one slice).
If I give Mioposto another go, whether via delivery or in person, I'll update the review but for now shelling out almost $15 for a trial run doesn't seem worth the hassle.",,,

Seattle, WA","Amazing food and great atmosphere!
This pizza shop was a great place for me to meet a friend. I ordered their lunch special: a Prosciutto e Arugula personal pizza and a side Cesar salad. The pizza was some of the best I had - crispy, Italian style with obviously fresh ingredients. Their Cesar salad was nicely balanced and a great complement. The number one thing I loved was the service. Our waitress was extremely attentive but gave my friend and I enough space to chat. We must've talked at our table for a couple of hours but our waitress was immediate on getting our checks and not bothersome when we delved into our conversation. I would definitely come back for their food and definitely recommend this as a good meeting spot!",,,

You can order a selection of personal pizzas, salads, drinks, and appetizers for under $10 each. The regular prices aren't terrible either, but if your curious, I'd opt for the happy hour just to try it out first. I usually order the antipasti because of the large portions and delicious taste. I'm not much of a pizza person, but I will say that their crust is amazing! Everything is stone fired so it has a wonderful texture with just a hint of smokey-ness. Yum! One thing to note though is that this place is no secret. It's loved by many so if you don't go early, or make a reservation, you will be waiting. Enjoy!",,,

This was my second visit and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed.
I had their Margarita pizza - it was the best Margarita I've ever had. My sister and so ordered the Zucca Balsamica. It was hard to decide which was my favorite. The crust was delicious. The toppings on the Zucca was a perfect mix of flavors.
It was also fun to watch the pizza chef cook them in the wood fireplace.",,,

Seattle, WA","LOVED this cozy neighborhood, wood-fired pizza spot!
First of all, the location is very cute. It's in a pretty neighborhood with a park across the street. Nice outdoor and indoor seating (some of the seats indoor have open windows with a pretty view of the neighborhood).
We went on the weekend (late Saturday afternoon) and opted for their small salad and pizza combo (note: it's only available until 3pm), which was a steal (I believe it was $14/person, but I could be a few dollars off). I got the beet salad and margarita pizza (extra crispy) and my husband got the caesar salad and pepperoni pizza with prosciutto on the side. We both LOVED everything! The beet salad was perfectly tossed in dressing and I loved the crumbled almonds. The pizzas were a smaller size on the combo special, so that made us feel a little healthier :) They were perfectly crispy with a perfect balance of flavors.
We also tried a few Washington wines. My husband got their cab and I got the red blend. Both of us were impressed! The red blend was very full-bodied and so smooth.
The service was great as well! Everythign was timed well with apps coming out and then the pizzas shortly afterwards.
If you are looking for a great go-to pizza spot, I highly recommend giving this spot a try!",,,

Kitsilano, Vancouver, Canada","Mioposto is located on the corner of a cute neighborhood in south seattle. We came here on a Sunday around 11:45a as a party of 2 and did not have to wait for seating. The restaurant was about 1/2 full when we got there.
They have tables throughout their restaurant but also 4 spots of high top window seating at the front. We got seated by the windows which was perfect on a spring seattle morning! You get to people watch as you eat too because there's a cute park right across the street.
They have a brunch menu available so of course we went for those options. The waiter was really kind to walk us through the menu and I thought it was cool that everything was cooked in their fire oven. We ended up getting...
-THE BAKER - kind of reminded me of a shakshuka and i'm not entirely sure why it wasn't called a shakshuka because it tasted like and texturally was so similar to one! This dish was delicious and it comes with their house made bread. Their eggs were perfectly poached and the yolks were runny.
-MORNING HASH - what is brunch without hash browns? Their hashbrowns are cooked in a skillet in their fire oven to get that extra crispyness. You can get the eggs how you want, we chose sunny side up, one of the eggs was sunny and runny but the other was kind of cooked which was a little disappointing. Pancetta was crispy and flavorful and the arugula pairs well with the dish for a refreshing little kick of flavor and texture.
Our waiter also served our food and came with mini bottles of cholula and tapatio hot sauce; this i really appreciated and im sure all condiments/cholula/tapatio-on-brekkie-food friends can relate ;)
Overall a great experience and they actually do bottomless mimosas for brunch (i noticed this a little too late!) which I have to come back for next time! Their breakfast stramboli (like a breakfast calzone) sounded and looked awesome (yes i also spy on what my neighboring strangers order...) and I would love to try that next time.",,,

Sunset, Vancouver, Canada","No trip to Seattle is complete without my Mioposto! I usually stay nearby the Mt. Baker joint, or within commuting distance. My first time here, I dined in because it was summer, and I was staying nearby in an Airbnb - they recommended this place!
I don't eat meat, but that doesn't matter. You need to try the Quattro Formaggi pizza! The lemon zest makes it!!!
In fact, I have recommended this pizza by word of mouth than any other restaurant I've ever been to!!!
Last trip I ordered via a delivery service as it was further away, raining, cold, and I had had a cocktail or two! I am happy to know I can get my order in! I ordered 2 pizzas: my usual & the crowd favourite Con le Petate.
My take on the Patate: wayyyy too much oil. Like the pizza crust was soaked in oil and the box even was leaking oil all over. I think the chef used the whole bottle of truffle oil on it. It was 15,000 calories a slice after that. The taste was good, but you just can't get the oils off of your hands or palate for hours. Worst of all: I made a huge mess at my host's place by placing the box on the counter while I ate (yes, I cleaned it up but took ages). Would I order it again? Absolutely no!!!
Stick with the Quattro Formaggi...sincerely the best pizza I have ever had!",,,

I would be curious how the pizza tastes, and would be willing to try that but with a gluten allergy, italian places dont usually cater well to me. I was impressed that they brought hot sauce with breakfast, and no ketchup in sight, in fact, they dont even have it! Cute spot though. Glad we stopped by.

Seattle, WA","I am giving 4 stars due to the service. My friends took me here for my 18th birthday and when we arrived, we were told it was a 25 minute wait, but we waited almost an hour. We wouldn't have minded an hour wait, but the upsetting part is being told a false wait time. It also seemed like staff was taking their time.
The actual server we had was really nice even though she had lost her voice. I liked her service a lot, she wished me a happy birthday like 3 times, made me feel kinda special.
Now for the food.
We got the potato pizza and the classic pizza (forgot the names). The pizza with the thinly sliced potatoes was amazing! I have never had a pizza with potatoes on it, it was so unique and delicious. The other pizza was just a cheese pizza, but not much cheese. It was still yummy though.
To top off the night, we had ordered their chocolate mousse cake and it was fucking bomb as hell. I was going to eat the whole thing by myself, but I had to let my friends try a little bit to experience the taste (plus they brought 3 forks LOL). I loved the cake and I'll probably come back just for the cake alone.
I believe this place doesn't take reservations unless it's a large group, so just be prepared for some waiting. There's really nowhere to wait except in the crowded entry way. For the business, I would recommend setting up a text messaging system to alert people when their table is going to be ready.",,,

It just seemed like a good place to be. They have very large open windows for air to flow through on the hot summer nights. People were sitting inside and outside the restaurant.
We just walked in at 8pm with 4 people,no wait. The server was very friendly and fast, our drinks came in a couple minutes.
The prices were reasonable for Seattle. I ordered a meatball sandwich, others had a pizza, lasagna, and a beat salad with chicken.

My only complaint, which I might follow up on: while I was there, that same woman said something off-color to her Spanish-speaking cook about needing to get him English classes.

I ordered their special of the day, which was like a Chicken Club but with a twist. It had crispy onions and a great sauce that was on the lettuce in the sandwich. I want to say it was called a CBC or something. Anyways, it was amazing! I am not a huge sandwich fan either.

Super tender, moist in it's natural juices all served on Le Panier's wonderful bread, caramelized onions on that mofo too makes it even that much better. A good schmeer of horseradish to clear out your sinuses too. Very good and this may be my new go-to sandwich here.

It's a tiny shop and I spent much of my time there standing around, wondering if the other people in there had already ordered or if there was a line. It turned out that I was the only person who hadn't ordered yet, but both employees were working on the line, putting together orders. When I did place my order, I wasn't given a number (the five or so people in front of me hadn't gotten one either) so when the lady called out a number and order, we had no idea whose order it was. We just tried to guess based on who got there when. It seems like there could be a better system in place so there isn't any confusion.
I have to agree with another reviewer that my sandwich was... fine. The bread was fresh, but the sauce was underspiced, and the meatballs, while tender, were bland and nothing really special.
Lunch in this neighborhood is usually about $10-12 and that's about what I paid today.

The chicken is perfectly fried, the sauce and cheese ratios are on point, and the sub roll is lightly toasted (that last piece is of particular importance to me).
I've since gone back to try the Italian sandwich, as well as the Meatball sub. Both were good, but not great--I've definitely had better back east--but still tasty sandwiches nonetheless.

I'm a little picky about how sweet desserts are and usually shy away from cannolis because they always feel like a mouthful of sugar, but these were just the right amount of sweet and crunchy! There's a menu of 5-6 different types and I scooped up the Original, Espresso, and Lemon. They're made to order, too, so the shells are fresh, the filling is a really lovely smooth consistency and (again) not overpoweringly sweet. The lemon was my fav hands down, and it wasn't a long wait for 3 large cannolis at all. Service was fast, efficient, and polite!

So, both of us ordered the original of the large, which they fill in store. The original is a vanilla cream-filled cannoli with chocolate chips on the ends.
The space is small, but luckily, my friend and I were the only patrons so found some bar stools by the window. My cannoli was good, and though I am not a cannoli expert by any means, visiting Holy Cannoli makes me wanna be one! The shell was stiff, but easy to bite into and the vanilla cream was solid, and I really liked that it was served at a chilled temperature. For next time though I definitely would want to do a small cannoli, as I thought the large size was so rich for just one person. I'd also like to try the other flavors, like the coconut or Nutella!

It was a quick walk from the science center and basically marked the edge of Belltown (we walked to another spot in Belltown afterwards!). The shop seats maybe 15 and serves soups (when available), sandwich (when available), cannolis and caffeinated beverages!
The just nearly eeked out a four in my book, mostly because the sandwich our little guys had was so good - the seven mile special - it was a Seattle porcine party on crusty bread! Out turkey Sami was just so so- I think we were the last folks ordering sandwiches that night and we definitely got the vibe that our presence wasn't really required for our baristas evening to be complete. Not rude, but similar to a cat - not caring a lot either way.
We shared 3 Cannolis - chocolate, original and lemon. All were very good, though a bit expensive. I think 3 were something like $9, so not cheap but not so expensive that you had to eat at the crumbs.
By the time we were there, they were out of soup, a couple sandwiches, a few cannolis and some beverages. A bit weird but c'est la vie'. I imagine that 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon isn't totally prime time, but not having a number of items was a bit lame. Again, first world problems!

Saw this on the Yelp map and decided to give it a try since it was near our breakfast spot. Each cannoli is $3 which is a tad bit pricey but I am on vacation, so I don't mind.
I ordered 3 different cannoli: original, salted caramel pecan and banana cream pie. I asked the cashier if she had any recommendations and she said that they are all about the same, just different flavors. No difference in texture or anything.
My favorite would be the banana cream pie. It had a hint of banana flavor and it was not too sweet. The salted caramel pecan was a miss for me. It sounded promising but I didn't think it was that great. I feel like the outside shell was not that fresh for the cannoli since it was kind of stale.

I love Cannolis and I had some time to kill so cannolis felt like a brilliant idea. This quaint little shop is easy to find and it has a tight interior with a few small table tops. I believe the majority of the people here order to go.
Cannoli Prices:
- $3/each
- $16/half dozen
- $28/dozen
These cannolis are fresh baked daily and they are freshly stuffed throughout the day. Adrian, the owner, was telling me if she had any leftover from the night before, she would sell them in the morning for half price. That's awesome business ethics.
I decided on buying 3 cannolis and I had every intention on saving them for later, but they were so delicious I actually ate all three within minutes of buying them. Had I known sooner, I would have probably gotten then half dozen or dozen. Anyways, I had the nutella, almond toffee crunch and lemon. They were all delicious but my favorite among the three was probably the almond toffee crunch.
Holy Cannoli is definitely a gem that I would recommend if you are visiting the Seattle area. There Italian pastries can be found in many places, but it is rare that you can get baked and stuffed so fresh!",,,

Bellevue, WA","This review is for the cannoli only. I'm from the east coast...where imo, anything cannoli will be better than anywhere on the west. I was proven wrong today. This spot right here...has some goood stuff that reminded me of back home. New York and Jersey are still my top picks though.
The crunch and breakoff texture is on point...right before that cool filling hits and lushly melts away with the rest of your bite. Banana Cream Pie, Almond, Tiramisu, Traditional, or whatever flavors that excite you...will satisfy without cloying from too much sweetness.
I feel like I'm a different man after having a cannoli here. You know...like I have just discovered why my girl friends go all wow on these things. I'm on the hunt for some more sweet eats now.
5 stars baby! Do ittt!!!",,,

I've been to Italy and really missed the italian cannolis so these definitely hit the spot! They didn't taste identical to the italian ones, but they were a nice treat! The shell was crispy and crunchy and there was a generous amount of filling in each cannoli! The shop is small and there was no wait when I went. The parking lot across the street also had a nice view of the space needle, which was cool. I would go here again to fulfill my sweet tooth craving!",,,

We came an hour before they were going to close, so when we were looking for what kind of cannolis to get, it was slim pickings. But the girl at the counter was so nice.. she said she would fill the other cannolis she had with whatever flavor we wanted! We ended getting 4 - 2 of the traditional and 2 of the coconut. There are 2 sizes, but we opted for the smaller one and it was just perfect! Not too sweet and it had a great crunch. My favorite was the traditional :)
Just a note - we saved 2 for later.. and they were a little soggy - don't wait to eat them!",,,

Seattle, WA","With the discovery of this find, cannolis are brought justice. The very first time I had a cannoli, it was absolutely a pleasure to eat. Following, I had many soggy and bubblegum (Why did they all taste so similarly bad..) flavored cannolis. I have finally been delivered a good cannoli.
We got the Traditional and Salted Caramel Pecan Cannolis in their smallest available form.
Started with the Traditional. Every bite was crunchy. Not a soggy crunch (like an old waffle cone), but a light crispy crunch. The filling was smooth, creamy, and fresh. It was sweet, but not overpoweringly sweet. A perfect sweetness ratio achieved with the shell (the chocolate chips were nice additions). The perfect combination! I was very impressed. (She actually whipped up the Traditional Cannoli when there weren't any in the display.)
The Salted Caramel Pecan was richer in sweetness than the Traditional. It had the caramel and pecan flavors to elevate it from being a regular Traditional cannoli, but the quality of the cannoli shell was just as perfect as the Traditional.
We both liked the Traditional better, but for those wanting a richer sweet, try the Salted Caramel Pecan! I definitely do want to try the other flavors..
Service was awesome. She was great with making us feel very welcome.
Parking is done along the street (paid) - no worries! There is ample space around this location.

They're definitely on the pricier side ($3 per mini cannoli). I got the nutella & the coconut ones. Typically I'm not a big cannoli fan because they're super sweet and overbearing.

Seattle, WA","I can't say that this is the best takeout food in Seattle because i haven't been to every restaurant (yet) but my goodness, this might be the best takeout in Seattle.
Found Limoncello during the covid crisis while searching for an Italian restaurant for my teen's birthday meal, and based on the review we decided to take a chance. Working with Chicco was not just a breeze, it was fun! I gave him a few ideas of what my family likes and he put together a menu that felt like he was in our heads. But of course, the real test is the food.
The food. Was. Amazing. The appetizer platter that he put together was incredible and had some of the best mortadella and caprese we've ever eaten (the mozzerella, omg). The mains were somehow even better - I am not a fan of gnocchi, they are usually chewy and heavy, but I tried one and it was pillowy soft and melted in my mouth. The tagliatelle with chicken and pesto was my other favorite, the fresh pasta, the pesto - all made to perfection. My only disappointment was that we didn't get to try his desserts - omg there's a whole case of them and they look like something out of a magazine!
Can't wait to order from them again, and I really can't wait until the city re-opens and I can sit down in Chicco's restaurant and enjoy a meal in his company.",,,

I wanted to support them and bought their 3-course dinner (plus wine) last night and was blown away! We got two appetizers, two entrees and a dessert sized for two plus a full-sized bottle of wine for $49. Everything was delicious, the ingredients clearly top notch (where did they find those amazing tomatoes??) and frankly the portions were so large that we have enough for two nights (well, except for the dessert, which we couldn't resist). Now I've changed my opinion--I'm not supporting them, they're supporting me and all the rest of the community with a wonderful way to destress and get something way better than what my wife and I can cook at home. Please give them a try and keep them open!! I'll be back--soon and frequently even after things get back to normal.",,,

What sets it apart are the pastries and THE PASTA! Today I ordered the penne with grilled chicken and a daffodil lemon tart. The owner asked me if I wanted to try the freshly made fettuccini instead of the penne and I ALWAYS take his recommendations--The never cease to disappoint. It is amazing! Not to mention enough for two servings. I literally watched him unwrap the roll of pasta dough, cut in right on the cutting board in front of me and put it in the skillet.

Seattle, WA","I'm so thrilled that Limoncello has touched down in Belltown. The building it's in was in dire need of a cute occupant, and it certainly is just that. The inside is so quaint and picturesque. I first noticed this place just by passing by on the sidewalk, and otherwise wouldn't have known about it at all. Some sweet smells wafted from the doors, and I thought oh, I'll have to try this. I'd assumed it was just a bakery, but boy was I wrong! They've got it all...
My date and I shared a chocolate tart, a pressed salami sandwich that came with an arugula salad, and an order of eggplant parm. We dove into the chocolate tart first while we waited on the other items, which took a little while with only two folks staffed, from the looks of it. The sandwich was juicy and full of really delicious meat, but the salad was really amazing. The cheese they topped it with and the Balsamic were just perfect. The eggplant parm came out piping hot and full of fresh oregano. What a comforting dish! So much cheese!
I honestly can't wait to take dates here, cozy up with a coffee and pastry in a booth, and have a glass of wine at their bar. The varied seating options really leave it open to anything. Hell, they even had sports on a big TV if that's your thing.
So why the -1 star? Growing pains, which maybe isn't fair, but having just started out, they clearly haven't gotten it all figured out yet. 1) put your prices up, please 2) make the menus easier to understand 3) the space is varied and cute, but it left some disorganization in terms of where the line started/orders were taken, and the wine bar on the side seemed totally forgotten... I also winced as the woman behind the pastry counter accidentally knocked a croissant right into a full cake, damaging the beautifully frosted top. Like I said, growing pains!",,,

The interior is nice- seating is a bit limited, but the place itself is spacious. It has high ceilings, a glass case where you can ogle the pastries, a bar top where you can sit and watch the chef/patissier doing his craft, and some booths along the wall for dining.
First of all, the service. I personally witnessed the owner & chef greeting & good-byeing every customer. He even ran to open the door for a lady who had her hands full. All while graciously answering every question I asked him. When I asked him about the pastas, he explained every pasta with detail. Interestingly enough, my boyfriend and I had stopped by a week before and even though we didn't dine at that time, he remembered me.
I settled on a manicotti, and it was delicious!!! The pasta tubes were stuffed with roasted chicken, ricotta cheese, spinach, and bechamel sauce. They were nestled in tomato sauce, and were topped with 2 tomatoes. I devoured it, and will definitely be back to try the other dishes... especially one of the tarts that I was eyeing!!!

Everything was amazing, and you can really taste the quality in the ingredients used in each dish. Examples in the generous fresh parmesan & the scratch made chocolate dessert.

I ordered lasagna to go and it took quite a while. Maybe order ahead of time next time I walk down!

If you're only two people, you can almost always expect to be sharing a table with someone else so be aware of that if you expect a table for just the two of you.
We have tried everything on the menu and from the appetizers to the desserts to the drinks, we have been blown away everytime. We've already been here three times this month with three different groups and its only the 19th!!
I highly recommend the clam pizza and the mushroom with truffle oil. Their marinara sauce is a godsend and you should definitely order a side of it for dipping. It comes warm, it's the perfect consistency, the perfect amount of kick, and so flavorful. For our groups, we like to order a pizza a person so we can maximize different experiences and we'll order a sauce for every two people. I will say that the little budino dessert is personally one of my favorites but its on the smaller side and definitely leaves me wanting more for the $11 price tag.
When I'm having a rough day at work, I seriously consider having ubereats deliver the mushroom pizza to me as a comfort food.",,,

Seattle, WA","(this doesn't read like a 4 star review at the start, but stick with it)
We had some Tom Douglas gift cards and my wife picked here to go, luckily just before COVID destroyed society.
I am super not a fan of Tom Douglas because I feel all his places are kind of tired and drifting -- like he's a great cook who over expanded his empire and is coasting on reputation not the actually quality of the food. So my feeling is that the typical Tom Douglass restaurant is over-priced and mediocre, with one or two hits, and lots of misses.
So I was pretty salty we were going here, but it was free-ish. I also was not a fan because I recalled from my last visit that all they have is messed up ""Seattle Twist"" pizzas. I call something Seattle Twist when the chefs do something baffling (and usually very sweet) to be edgy, and it tastes exactly the way you think it would -- bad -- because they have no idea what they're doing and there's a reason no one ever put jam on a grilled cheese because it's #$%^& gross.
Anyway, my main memory of Serious Pie the previous time I went, in 2011 was ""I had to sit with strangers at a big table, it took forever, it was super loud, and all the pizzas were messed-up gourmet nonsense."" I'm down for gourmet pizza, but please also show me you can make the best pepperoni or cheese pizza around, before you start adding jelly or nutmeg to a pizza.
Anyway we got there and it was loud, the host was kind of surly, etc. But eventually we sat down (at a normal table for two). The menu -- I swear to god -- had not changed in 9 years. Same pizzas, same apps, everything was identical. This is what I mean about Tom Douglass restaurants coasting. Everyone sitting around us was there for the first time -- lots of Seattle tour books; the mom and son next to us was there looking at UW, etc. (They were super sweet, by the way and seemed to be having a great time in Seattle, so I hope they hold the trip as a great memory!)
I was trying soooo hard not to be salty, and I did pick the one pizza that is halfway normal -- sausage and peppers.
Ok. Holy crap, that was a good pizza. There were certain bites where it was like, better than east coast pizza. Just amazing sauce, amazing cheese, great flavors, good spice level, awesome sausage.
Everything else I said about Tom Douglass, Inc. is true and I stand by it, but damn that pizza was good.
Two pizzas, some apps, and maybe two glasses of wine was like $100 with service fee (it's not a tip!), it's still over-priced, but it was good and overcame my salt with serious quality.
I think Tom is coasting on the tourist trade, so idk if he's going to survive COVID, but these pizzas were good.",,,

We arrived around 4pm so their Happy Hour was in full force All of their regular menu pizzas were $7 for a half-size and they had a few beers and $7 wines on special as well. The corte alla flora sangiovese was quite good actually. The pizzas were the perfect size for sharing. I would suggest for two average appetite adults, you order at least 3 of their half-sizes. My favorite was their Mozzarella Di Bufala Pizza. Light, buttery, and with the right amount of doughy chewiness. Fresh cheese and toppings round out these winning pizzas.

Serious Pie,(206) 838-7388,"Carol L.
Orange County, CA","Some of the most unique pizzas I've ever had! My family really loved their pizzas, but I personally wasn't the biggest fan because I generally don't like herbs. We got the Yukon gold potato, which I was really excited about because potato on a pizza was the ultimate carb overload. But the flavor of the rosemary felt too overpowering to the point where even scraping the herb off wasn't helping. We also got the sweet fennel sausage. Again, not a fan of herbs so I didn't really like the fennel, but this pizza was more palatable for me. In retrospect, if I had ordered the pizzas without the herbs, I would have loved them more. But I do think the herbs really help differentiate Serious Pie's pizzas from that of other restaurants. Food for me would have been 3 stars, but their service was great so I'm giving 4 stars. My family would give it 5 stars though!

TLDR crispy, thin crust pizza with quality ingredients that you can taste! Definitely a pizza place I'd splurge on again at some point. The pizzas run about $25 with the 20% service charge and are individual sized.
Service:
Very good service, so it definitely earns that 20% service charge even when eating solo. I never felt ignored and my waiter checked on me just often enough for my water refill and for the check. He was also very helpful with which pizza to choose.
Location:
Pretty small, shared table arrangement with other groups. Turn over rate is pretty quick considering it's a pizza place. Nice, cozy, pizza smelling, no complaints from me! Try to walk if you can because it looked hard to find parking! In fact, a family left their car in the middle of the road with the emergency lights on just for the family to get out to wait in line (not that I approve of it).
Food: where -1 star
Very tasty, I liked both the special and the egg pizza. I enjoyed the layers of flavors - lemony, bitter arugula; salty meat; savory, creamy egg. One thing I didn't like about the pizza was that the toppings came off with one bite but maybe it can be solved with putting more force into the knife? It was really hard to enjoy toppings in every bite, but not too much of a complaint since the crust was soooo good too.",,,

Seattle, WA","It goes without saying that Tom Douglas has an enormous influence on the Seattle restaurant scene, so naturally this place was recommended to me by many people.
I ordered the clam pie which came with penn cove clams, pancetta tesa, and lemon thyme. The pizza was very balanced with the briny taste of the clams, the crispness of the crust and the rich umami of the pancetta tesa, and a bit of acidity from the lemon. The crust was more cracker than bread and the pizza itself seemed more flatbread than a pizza. Honestly, the crust is about the same as a MOD Pizza cooked ""well-done."" The pizza is extremely light, and if you're a big eater like me, you won't feel satisfied with one pie.
Service was attentive, although it did take a fair amount of time to get the pies out. Taste is definitely 4 stars but for $20, the value is a bit questionable. More than half the surface area of the pie is just bread without toppings. They also charge a mandatory 20% service charge in lieu of a tip. I like the spirit of this policy, but 20% is too high in my opinion. I was always taught that 15% is standard for service, and anything above is for exceptional service or large parties.
Pro Tip: Go here for an expensed work lunch, but not on your own.

Seattle, WA","penn cove clams, pancetta tesa, lemon thyme - Every now and then, you go to a pizza joint but don't want the traditional marinara and mozzarella. This dish has that delicious flavor adjustment. The clams were the star flavor, with the pancetta tesa's fresh taste complimenting the clam, all accented by the thyme lemon (although the lemon was only slightly noticeable). The crust - perfectly crispy and chewy in the right spots - seemed to be seasoned deliberately to match the seaside flavor profile. Sometimes pizzas are exactly what you would expect; this time, I found myself wishing I was on the beach with friends and sharing this pizza.

Las Vegas, NV","I was on a trip to Seattle and decided to stop by Serious Pie since it was recommended by a friend and they had 4k reviews. It was a lot smaller, cozier, unassuming than I had expected.
Pizzas are good. I usually leave my crusts uneaten but this crust was very crispy, flavorful and a good ending to the toppings. Each pizza was large enough for 1.5 persons or a very hungry person. We ordered 3 pizza among 4 people and that was more than enough. This is listed from my favorite to least favorite (all still good):
1. seasonal mushroom/truffle cheese
2. sweet fennel sausage/provolone
3. soft egg/proscuitto/arugula
At about 15-20$ per pizza, it is slightly overvalued. It is in a big downtown location so that may be why. I liked it but I don't think I would recommend coming to Seattle specifically to eat this.",,,

We were seated after a few minutes of waiting, add a community table. In Seattle, apparently there is a mandatory 20% tip that is already added to your check. So just FYI. The pizza here was the best pizza I have ever had in my life! I am originally from New York and pizza is very hard for me to like. We had the truffle pizza and the margarita pizza it was delicious! We had the beets, blueberries and pistachios for appetizer.
We had cannolis for dessert and they were not disappointing as well! The restrooms are locked with a code which they share very easily. Very light crust and small selection of pizzas but every single bite is tasty! You don't even need pepper flakes! The pizzas are very flavorful and let's just say I'm going back before I leave Seattle!!!",,,

Just the place itself, it's super cozy and modern. I would totally recommend coming here for a date. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by for dinner the night before his birthday. We had heard great things about it so of course, being the food enthusiasts that we are, we had to check it out. The wait was short & once we were seated, we got a perfect little spot by the window.
Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. We were thankful for her honest recommendations when we asked for advice!

With our amount of people, we decided to just order several different pizzas and share. I had the opportunity to try the Margherita pizza and their potato and rosemary pizza. Both of the pizzas had good flavor. I personally think that the pizzas themselves are just okay. I think it's the style of pizza because they come out in an oval shape and each slice is very thin. Their crust style is the burnt firewood type of pizza, which isn't my favorite. I'm definitely more of a classic triangle NY pizza style person. All in all, I'd probably come back for HH since you can get half a pizza for $7 which is a great deal.",,,

The clam pizza is amazing (who would have thought to put clams on a pizza?!). There is so much flavor and depth to the pizza here, the crust is cooked to perfection with just the right amount of char.
The salads are also very delicious. The kale salad is our favorite - tons of flavor but you can't go wrong with the butter lettuce too, I think it's a cesar type of dressing on it. We ordered the melon with prosciutto ""salad"" this time and that was also very tasty - didn't realize melon and meat could pair so well!
Order a side of the marina as well, you won't be disappointed as you're scraping the last bits off the ramkin with your pizza crust.",,,

San Diego, CA","The food was great, freshly cooked with ingredients that weren't processed. The pizza we got had the sausage in it and the flavors blended well together without being overly salty or greasy like most pizzas. I actually enjoyed the thin crust and one pizza was enough to share with my boyfriend and I but it doesn't make you completely full. The environment seemed professional, almost too serious.
Definitely more of a place to go to when you're feeling fancy or going on a date. The seating is more intimate so it'd be perfect to have conversations. Not that great for bigger parties like my friends and I. The experience was fun but the pizza itself wasn't anything different from Blaze Pizza or some other non-chain pizza place.

The pizza here is awesome. The crust is thin without being burnt, and the ingredients are fresh and interesting. I'm not normally a big fan of thin crust pizza, but Serious Pie does a fantastic job. I would definitely recommend splitting multiple pizzas with friends, so that you can try as many flavors as possible.",,,

Buffalo pizza, calzone and clam pizza were all incredibly delicious
Service good
Cons:
Too dark of an ambiance for me.
Food is not only about satisfying the hunger but also pleasing the senses, which is extremely important for overall satisfaction.
Beautiful colors of freshly and masterfully cooked ingredients pleasing to the eyes are just as important as smell, texture and taste. It was too dark to see my food.
My recommendation would be to increase lighting a bit where it's still a pleasant atmosphere and customers can take advantage of good lighting to actually see the beautiful creations of the chef. After all it's not a bedroom, it's a dining room.",,,

The caesar salad was a deconstructed salad and was hard to share with people. Their dressing was really good though. My sister ordered their marinara pizza, but altered it to have no marinara and add garlic. I have to say that her custom order was the best meal that day. The second best dish was the calzone.
The Quattro and Dante pizza were sad in my book. They were really soggy and was hard to eat. The prosciutto or whatever meat was on the Dante pizza, in my opinion, made the pizza taste a little funky.
I don't know if I would come back again.. the service was good but the food was not up to par. Maybe if someone invited me here again I would have to give it a second chance and update my review.",,,

Burrata was brought out with a few cherry tomatoes. The waiter asked us if we wanted anything to go with it. We ask for bread because in my experience it comes with bread. Told us she'll put in a order of focaccia but need to warm it in the oven. A) we got our focaccia after or main came out b) it was just pizza flat bread without toppings not focassia c) why didn't you suggest this when we place our order instead of after bring it out
Then the pasta was pretty much boiled spaghetti in a soup. I've never seen bolognese sauce so pink and watery you can spoon and slurp it like tomatoe soup. The spaghetti all's vongole was under season and just tasted like water. It was hard to get someone to bring some salt.",,,

The pizza was supposed to have mozzarella on it, but instead came cheeseless with arugula instead. Rather than offering to comp the piZza or make a new one, they have us 25% off, which felt paltry. Our server was very helpful and prompt and gracious, but it felt like he was trying to swim upstream with a poorly run kitchen and grouchy management.

I politely made my note to the waitress, and she literally ignored what I was telling her.

Like the pizzas are is so good. Kinda cramp/crowded as you get into the door. But like it's a separate seating section which has a good space.
The ladies are super super friendly. You know the type that should be working in customer service because they have the personality and attitude for it. Oh back to the food, well the pizza pies can generally feed 2 or if your super hungry you can if you want to admit it chow down the whole thing. I like that the menu isn't super complicated or over whelming with options.
The only negative is that it is in some what awkward spot and it is tough to find in the evening. Wish there was a big lighted sign. The neighborhood lacks good lighting and gets really dark like darker then usually at night for an area with restaurants.",,,

Two of us quickly grabbed a table on Saturday night around 6PM hungry and ready to feast. Let me start by saying the service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive, friendly and quick. We grabbed a nice bottle of red to enjoy with the pies (reasonably priced ~$50). My husband got a Margherita and I went for the Romana. Again, service was super quick and our pies came out quickly.
Unfortunately they just didn't taste great. The Margherita was burnttt (see pic). These wood fire pies usually take under 5 minutes to cook and I feel like for this kind of place they should have just made another pie real quick rather than serving us up something this burnt. And the Romana was so salty it was not even edible.
We are been looking forward to coming to Delancey for awhile now. I've heard such great things about this spot and it looks like a lot of fellow yelpers also agree that this place is good, we must have had an off night.

We got notified via text out table was ready and we're seated. It's a bit crazy at the door trying to get past people waiting and people trying to get in the list.
Our table was great and we ordered our pizza 1/2 bacon onion 1/2 sausage.
We'd thought about ordering 2 and I'm happy we didn't. The edges of the pizza were not lightly charred and beautiful from coming from the oven, all the edges were charred black. When I went to slide a piece off the pan lol the toppings slid off and went on the table. The center didn't seem quite cooked- more soppy. Also I've heard great things about the flavor of the dough. I'm not sure if it's because I didn't have a crust to taste but it lacked in flavor.

My party showed up on a Saturday evening and of course Delancey's was busy. There was a table available outside so we sat down and waited to be served. Within a few minutes we were told (rather rudely) that they were not serving outside that night because it was about to rain.
No big deal, we decided we either wanted to put our name on the list or order a few pizzas to go and take our chances with the weather (chairs were still out and there was no sign saying they weren't serving outside). We decided to split up our party and while some went in to order the pizzas, some went to order drinks from next door to enjoy while we were waiting.
We were refused the ability to order drinks, order pizzas, or put our name on the list. Not only were we completely off put by that, the hostess told us to ""go across the street if we wanted a drink"" and basically kicked us out. Another hostess attempted to apologize for her colleague's behavior, and allow us to order pizzas to go, but it was far too late for that.

Seattle, WA","The boyfriend and I were craving pizza for dinner. He wanted to try this place out so we decided to head over.
Street parking was a little challenging to find in that area, but we managed to find a spot fairly close by.
It's a pretty nice spot--not too big or small. They have a bar, a bunch of tables, and two restrooms. It was dimly lit but bright enough to comfortably eat and have nice conversation.
We each ordered a glass of wine and shared their mushroom pizza.
The two main reasons why I decided to give this place 3 stars is because the pizza was just alright. Our crust was a little burnt, but it wasn't a deal breaker. But I was hoping that the flavor would compensate for the semi-burnt crust. Unfortunately it didn't and it kind of bummed us out.
Second, the server, although pretty friendly when she first took our order, seemed either too busy with other tables, or maybe was preoccupied? But my boyfriend had noticed that when she came to our table to check on us, she walked up to our table to ask how we were doing, but was looking elsewhere and didn't give us any eye contact. It was weird enough that my boyfriend noticed. I guess for me, if the server doesn't really want to check up on our table, I'd rather they just drop the check off than half ass the acknowledgement.
After leaving the restaurant I was still craving something--anything to fulfill my flavor craving. I wasn't all that hungry but still felt like I needed something. So we ended up going to Jack N the Box to top the night off.
Can't say it was the best meal, but it wasn't horrible. But I can say that I'm happy that we at least tried it. Maybe it was the type of pizza that we ordered, who knows? Unfortunately, I can't say that we'll be returning anytime soon.",,,

We tried Essex on two other occasions of this trip and not only were the cocktails incredible, the small(er) menu delicious, but the service was friendly and inviting. Our waitress the first night gave us a handwritten list of her must-see Seattle recommendations which we loved.

We decided to order take out so we could enjoy our meal at home with our dog. We called in to make a to go order and the woman over the phone had a very rude tone and told us we cannot order over the phone we must come in person. This is pretty odd to me because the point of ordering to go is so you don't have to wait at the restaurant. We luckily live about 3 blocks away so we shrugged it off and went in to order. Once arriving there it was just a series of issues and utter rudeness from the hostess.
1 - messes up order; we ordered the sausage and the bacon and onion pizzas (2 separate pizzas on the menu), she charged us for a sausage pizza with bacon and onion.
2 - miss charges me; first charged us for 1 pizza with add-ons then charges us for 3 pizzas.
3 - messes up the void; doesn't void the original incorrect order; total jumped from $25 to $66
4 - fixes the void but doesn't provide receipt for proof
5 - doesn't acknowledge me when I ask for proof, just grabs the receipt and hands it to me; very cold, unfriendly, terrible customer experience.
The pizza itself was good. Nothing mind blowing or particularly unique. Perhaps it was over hyped to me, perhaps this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm giving this place a two stars because I was satisfied with my pizzas.
I've gone on this long without having Delancey and I'm fine continuing on the rest of my life not eating it again. I expected a much better customer experience and I'm highly disappointed.",,,

Los Angeles, CA","It would certainly help Delancey if the first person you meet, the hostess, was even slightly polite. But as can be referenced by several Yelp reviews - the hostess puts herself above the establishment and the patrons by treating interested customers with nothing but attitude and a power trip.
Our waitress was not much better, and instead of fire we got ice. She didn't smile once during any interaction and seemed humorless and unhappy to be at Delancey in general. At the end of our meal when my friend mentioned that the pizza should be labeled as spicy, she gave no apology and instead listed the ingredients.
To top it off, the pizza wasn't very good. Not that Delancey should be given a pass for rude behavior by making up for it with delicious pizza, but their pizza isn't even worth dealing with the unfriendly vibe.",,,

I've been a fan of Orangette since college, and I remember reading about this place when they opened and wanting to check it out. We took an Uber here, and it was a cozy and intimate spot, which I didn't mind because I was there with one of my good friends. So maybe my review is a rad biased because I already liked the food that Molly made on her blog.
I ended up ordering the Hot Salami pizza, which was soooo good. Beautifully presented, with slightly charred and bubbled topping. The freshness from the pizza seriously complemented the slightly sweet burnt edges, which was surprising to me. It was definitely large enough to split between two people or to just split up for a few meals as I did. :)

My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night after he read Molly Wizenberg's book and recommended we do dinner here. Despite its apparent fame, the restaurant was pretty empty for Saturday night at 8:30 pm but I'm not complaining since we were expecting a moderate wait!
We were immediately seated and our server was attentive and helpful. We ordered their hot salami pizza ($17) and the chocolate chip cookie ($3.50), as well as a pint of beer each. I can't remember which kinds we got but they were perfectly cold, contrasting with the oven-hot pizza.
Also yes - the pizza, oh baby. Dough was perfectly cooked, a bit tangy from the sourdough, and the sauce and cheese are divine. I wouldn't consider myself someone who loves pizza (more of a tacos gal) but this pizza made me consider it. The hot salami was fantastic, as well. If you're hungry, definitely get your own pizza! Even if you don't finish, the leftovers will be good.
As for the chocolate chip cookie, either get it in cookie dough or skip it and choose something else. After the amazing pizza, I had high expectations for it but it was a bit of a letdown because it was brittle and bitter.",,,

Olympia, WA","Long ago, I would've give them a five-star with a rambling review on how unbeatable they are. This was my all-time favorite pizza place. The crust was simply perfect: a balance of chewy and crackly-ness.
Now the crust is still as good as ever, but they burnt it quite a bit on our last visit. They replaced the interesting toppings (remember the kimchi) with generic ingredients. They also made a common mistake of overloading their pizza with cheese and sauces. It turned a once-beautiful crust very soggy.
Maybe I judged them too harshly, because they're held to a much higher standard in my mind. What changed for them? New management? Complacency? It could just be a really bad day, too.",,,

Woodinville, WA","We had actually heard about Pasta Nova awhile back from one of the wineries around Woodinville, but we never had a chance to try it. We recently moved into the area and decided to get take out. We were not disappointed!
My husband and I shared the homemade meatball appetizer and the Pappardelle Amatriaciana. We asked for the pappardelle amatriaciana to be extra spicy. Even after we got home, the dishes were absolutely delicious! The meatball was tender and juicy (and also very large). I thoroughly enjoyed the pappardelle amatriaciana. It wasn't terribly spicy, but there was enough for a slow burn the more you ate. The pasta itself was the perfect level of chewy and sauce-covered, and I thoroughly enjoyed the sausage and the chicken pieces.
They also gave us complementary bread, which we devoured in our attempt to get to every last drop of sauce. Heavily recommend this little joint!",,,

If your credit card machine is down, you should let people know when they come in. Writing all the credit cards and CVV numbers in a notebook and asking customers to sign it, is not OK. Anybody who gets the book (such as another customer or any worker) will have dozens of credit card numbers with names and CVVs. Great opportunity for credit card theft.
Oh, if customers say they will order their mains after the appetizers, that is exactly what they mean. No need to ask them 3 times if they want to order even before the appetizers have arrived!

Seattle, WA","I've been here quite a few times before and the food was always decent, but the service was always slow and not particularly attentive. Nothing standout but good enough to come back. However, this time was a particularly poor experience. The restaurant was half empty but since I came in with a larger group of 7 people, we were prepared to wait a while.
That said, we were told that they could not accommodate us at all - and not because there were outstanding reservations, or the restaurant was full, but simply because the kitchen did not want the ""added burden"" of having to serve 7 additional diners (we arrived at 7pm). We told them we could split up the groups, that the dishes could be fired and served whenever ready, and that we were willing to wait as we had already driven there. The hostess went back to the chef and was told there was no way we were getting served that night.
Listen, I understand a larger group can be inconvenient, but we were willing to be as flexible as possible to be accommodated - we were polite, we were patient, and we were willing to wait. The restaurant isn't tiny - 7 people, half empty restaurant, at peak dinner times shouldn't gridlock any functioning kitchen. The arbitrary refusal of service was rude, the reasons kept shifting (oh, we actually have a lot of reservations later tonight), and then another group walked in without a reservation and was seated and accommodated immediately.
As a local, building a community and dynamic around great service and positive interactions is what specifically brings me back to certain establishments. I've dealt with a number of different dining situations in which far more unreasonable requests were met with great service and attitude from owners or staff. The food is fine, but given this experience and interaction with the staff, we will not be coming back and instead recommend choosing somewhere else to spend your money.",,,

Seattle, WA","TLDR: fancy! Main entree may not be filling enough--get an appetizer.
Great romantic night in Italy feel! Check out those granite slab tables. The candle holders are nice too!
Also check out that water pitcher when they water you! Fancy schmancy stuff is going on here! Poor lighting conditions for food Paparazzi though--it's VERY dimly lit.
Excellent customer consideration regarding the outside temperatures since they have a curtain around the front door to shield you from drafts. You can dine in peace without feeling like Marylyn Monroe.
Menu is small and there seems to be more wine options than food items on the menu. But everything
Service: wait to be seated, order at the table: food, water, and check brought to you.
Complimentary warm bread and oil. Delicious! Too bad they don't give you more.
Chicken Tuscan: oh man that tang! Very good but might be too sour for some. The chicken is a whole breast fillet that you cut yourself. There is only one hunk of artichoke heart and one grape tomato on top of a few leaves of spinach. A slightly smaller proportion than what I'm used to but hey, that leaves you room for an appetizer or dessert.
Rigatoni Amatriciana: personally I'm a big fan of rigatoni so I like this dish. Comes with sliced Italian sausage and chicken. Italian sausage is slightly spicy but nothing I couldn't handle--I'm extremely sensitive to spice and I was fine.",,,

It is very cute inside. Traditional Italian flare you tend to see, but more intimate, which I quite liked. It gave the vibe you were in a basement joint in Brooklyn. The lighting was dim and warm.
As were the staff... I'm pretty sure our server was the owner. He was adorable, demure and very kind. He made sure we were well taken care of.
Our food was delicious, in a word. My mushroom ravioli was exactly what I had hoped it would be. Creamy and rich but not heavy, filled with a variety of flavorful mushrooms. Yum.
Hubby got the spaghetti bolognese and was happy with his choice. That huge meatball he said was delicious, and I loved the sauce. It was so flavorful with a hint of spice.

My family and I walked in tonight requesting a table for 4 for dinner. We looked around and saw there were a few open tables and thought PHEW. The place was busy, but not over flowing with people in anyway shape or form. We were told unless we had a reservation there are no tables available for us. Okay, weird wording, but that's fine we understand. So we ask if we can order food to go. They say no. WHAT?! Now this is when I get upset and confused. They said they're ""too backed up and can't take anymore orders"". I guess they better pray those other tables don't show up for their reservation any time soon. And that their current guests don't order anymore food.
To summarize it up. They need to change the amenities section to read:
Reservations only
Not good for families
Not good for kids
Not good for groups (since they apparently can't handle it)
We were definitely not welcomed here tonight for whatever reason. We weren't offered to wait for a table and weren't even allowed to order food to go.

Seattle, WA","My date and I have not had much luck with finding great new places to eat. We decided to try this place based on the high reviews. When we were there, the place wasn't crowded. The server asked if we had reservations. We said no. Server deliberated for a few minutes then said she would clear off a table. Could we wait 5-10 minutes? We said yes. She asked are you sure? We said yes. That was weird. I went to use the restroom and he was seated. I thought, ok, that wasn't much of a wait. I am sorry I cannot tell you the server's name nor the special... was never offered. Since we were on a date enjoying our time, I must have missed everything that the establishment did not provide to live up to such high reviews:
Ordered GAMBERON LINGUINE
Jumbo prawns and scallops tossed with linguine in a light and flavorful rosa sauce and finished with Dungeness Crab meat.
Sounds delicious right? Where is this rosa sauce? It was non existent. The linguine was dry. It was not fresh. I had to put in the olive oil that was from the bread to make it work. There was a lot of steam coming out of the dish. It was just heated up on high. The only thing that was prepared on the spot was the seafood lightly cooked. But one small bit of Dungeness crab meat on top of 1 scallop and 3 shrimps. Nothing to rave home about.
2nd dish LINGUINE BOLOGNESE
Traditional homemade Italian sauce with a giant meatball. pasta may be substitute for risotto.
Again, dry linguine and where is the sauce? Nothing to soak up. When I cut into this giant meatball it was dry too.
Cons:
-Service was flat, no personality
-linguine, dry.
-where is the sauce? Barely any sauce
-meatball huge, dry.
-coffee, asked for espresso shot, got regular drip coffee in a mug. No sugar or cream offered.
Pros:
-fast, food came out promptly
-tiramusu was good

So, in short, I would go back. BUT, I'm leaving a little hungry :( They have a $4 up charge for gluten-free pasta. I buy this stuff, so I know it's not that much to get good GF pasta for a reasonable price. So WHY am I leaving hungry? Small portions - maybe my wife would like the weight loss effect....... But, it's lunchtime, I'm hungry, and I just spend almost $50 on the ticket and....... I'm still hungry. I would be ecstatic about this place if I was full - really, the puttanesca was fabulous. Oh, and this is the one time I would have taken dessert, (I'm hungry!) But the server didn't offer it. Another good point - the wine was spot on! A very nice Italian Sangiovese - but, when I was done with the first glass and ready to have a second with the rest of my pasta, it took over 5 minutes and some waving to get my glass refilled - and he never refilled my water.

I ordered it medium rare and I must admit, it was wonderfully executed. Everything was perfect, the sauce, the doneness, the texture, the added pine nuts for just the right amount of crunchiness, along with the shoestring potatoes on the side. It was well worth the price.
The parmigiana was one of the best I've had thus far and made for an outstanding appetizer. The aubergine was cooked to perfection and covered in oozing pomodoro/mozzarella in the most luscious fashion, all of which came into an unequivocal whirl of awe after the first bite.

Those culinary fads have a place of their own, but Seattle is also home to some great classic and traditional fine dining experiences. Being in the northwest, this isn't a stuffy upscale experience but holds its own to great restaurants while still maintaining a sense of comfort and familiarity.
Having introduced a friend to this place a few months prior, we tentatively planned to come in for dinner sometime early in the new year and that time finally came around.
We ordered the baked eggplant, and the Caeser salad to start while deciding on a bottle of wine. Both were great choices, and while I'm not going to deduct points here- I would like to point out to management that the eggplant dish could have come out more warm. If you're one to enjoy the creaminess of eggplant while it is still hot with a well-melted cheese, perhaps you can make that request.
For dinner, we shared the gnocchi Sorrentina, the pesto prawn fettuccine, and the roasted free-range duck. The pesto was fresh and vibrant, with prawns cooked to perfection. The Gnocchi light and flavorful, and the duck was a great choice as well, despite being torn between that and the bone-in pork chop (next time..)
Overall a fantastic experience brought to a perfect close with a couple of espressos and a creme brulee to share. Whether it is a special occasion, celebration, date night, or just another excuse for a nice dinner out- don't miss out on Il Terrazzo Carmine. Cheers!",,,

From an amazing dinner to the incredible service, our evening was well spent! We both agreed that this was one of our best dining experiences we've ever had. It was definitely very memorable. We were very lucky to have a table since we reserved last minute for anniversary!
Our hostess and server were incredible. You know it's legit, when your hostess offers to take your jackets. At the end of night, she noticed taking our selfies outside and offered to take our photos. How sweet was she! Low key, she probably saw us struggling. And man, our server was so so kind and very attentive! He knew the menu from the heart.
It was a seafood night for us. For our antipasti, we started out with the Bruschetta con Granchio (dungeness crab w/ vine marinated tomatoes w/ basil oil). It was something we normally don't order, but it was very refreshing starter! I think we should've ordered something else to start since we ended up order more seafood.
- For his dish, he requested for the Linguine Alle Vongole (fresh Manila calms, chilies, garlic, parsley, & olive oil). He probably won't order this dish again because he's not a huge fan on Linguine, but he really wanted clams & he got a bunch of them!
- Me on the other hand ordered the Ravioli Pesce (large ravioli filled w/ crab, shrimp and spinach, with lobster sauce). Rich was so rich and buttery. It served well with the crab. I'm a very saucy girl, so I do wish there was more sauce since the crab didn't have too much seasoning.
At the end of the night, we were full on the amazing bread with this sweet balsamic vinegar and oil olive, topped with this creme br没l茅e we choose from their dessert tray! Definitely keep this restaurant on our books and coming back. Cute date spot and to dress up for!",,,

We ordered:
- Half a dozen oysters (5/5): So good and very fresh.
- Fricasse Di Funghi Selvaggi (5/5): This absolutely blew us away. The wild mushrooms were perfectly sauteed and seasoned, and the polenta was amazing - very flavorful without being overly salty.
- Scaloppine Di Vitello Al Limone & Capperi (5/5): The waiter, seeing how indecisive I was between ordering a pasta or this entree, kindly told me they could replace the red potatoes in this dish with whichever type of pasta I liked, so I decided on a side of linguini with pesto -- which was so simple but delicious. The veal itself was nicely done (it's more like a cutlet). All the entrees were served with a side of white broccolini, which I'd never had before but looked beautiful and tasted fresh! Was truly impressed with the attentiveness to detail at Il Terrazzo Carmine.
- I can't quite remember the name of the dessert -- the ""menu"" was actually a platter of 6 options they had that night, so we choose a 3-layered cake with a side of vanilla ice cream. It was amazing! They also had creme brulee, tiramisu, cheesecake, red velvet cake, etc.

The pasta dishes were fairly robust, though not super flavorful. Soups were pleasant if a little scant on ingredients. Bread was very good, though served with butter rather than olive oil and vinegar. Our server did the thing listing the dinner specials without mentioning prices, which always bugs me (it seems manipulative; you have to ask the price and feel like a cheapskate, or order and hope for the best while feigning wealthy nonchalance, or just avoid the specials altogether).
Tends more toward art food than a solid meal, not quite in the ""eat before you go"" category but leaning that way. Noise level was quite tolerable. A little too much reliance on salt in the dishes, though not terrible.

Portland, OR","Made reservations for an Italian dinner on a Saturday night and it exceeded my expectations.
Its located in the back of the lobby of Merrill Place. We arrived on time and stepped inside to the Host stand. They gave us the option of inside or outside and we opted to be seated outside since it was a beautiful, warm, summer evening.
The patio has chandeliers, fire pit, white linens, candlelights and fresh flowers on the tables and pillows at my seat. It was beautiful.
Service was very good and attentive. Water and bread was brought out quickly to the table.
We started with Prosciutto con Melone. Cantaloup is in season and it was delivered ripe with imported parma prosciutto. Very Good.
Ordered a 1/2 dozen of the oysters of the day. These were fresh and served at the perfect temperature and with a mignonette. The mignonette was all that was needed to balance the saltiness.
For my entree, I ordered the Risotto of the Day. Served w/Wagyu and Gorgonzola. The wagyu was not as tender/buttery as I expected and the gorgonzola was mild. I had hoped for stronger flavors. However, the risotto was prepared well.
We were too full to consider dessert.
Good cocktail & wine selection; started with a cocktail and ended with a chianti.
Service was attentive and spot on.

The decor is okay enough, nothing too special, the lighting is a bit bright (like I wish they had candles on the tables) but my goodness, the food. It's sooo good.
Also, I love that it's a family-owned place. It's Greek and the family is Greek. An ethnic restaurant run by ethnic people (unless it's Mexican) isn't very common in upscale, vanilla Seattle. If you're lucky, you'll run into the grandma on Saturday nights serving tables. She's the sweetest. The whole family is. There have been times I've asked for a particular pasta with particular veggies and they make whatever I want.
We have three kids and they can accommodate a large family like ours and thank God, it's one of the few reasonably priced places in Seattle. It's not cheap but it's not overpriced. Because it's not overpriced, we go there probably every two weeks.

Usually Alfredo can be too heavy for my taste at restaurants but this had the perfect consistency- not too heavy and tons of flavor.

Jacksonville, FL","I'm a little unsure about why this place is rated so highly. I came for dinner about a week ago and it was basic and mediocre. I ordered pasta because it looked like that's what the whole restaurant was ordering, so I figured it must be good. I ended up with mushy overcooked pasta and overcooked shrimp. The pesto sauce wasn't special either. It's possible that it might have come from a jar?
They were very busy so perhaps the kitchen was slammed and that's why the food wasn't cooked properly? Perhaps this is also the reason why service wasn't great. It took a long time for anyone to approach us at the table, and when they finally did it was very ""what are you getting?"" instead of ""Hi, welcome, have you dined with us before?"" The rest of dinner was the same short cold service. It felt like they just wanted us gone to open the table for someone else.
I'm quite disappointed because I had such high hopes. It always seems packed with people and the Yelp ratings were so high that I thought it would be fantastic, except it wasn't. Nothing special about this place.",,,

Seattle, WA","Please don't pass this place up! The interior does not speak to the food. I promise.
I'd happily come here just for the tiramisu! But everything I've had so far is amazing.
The owner loves to stop and chat, and is very knowledgeable about what's going on in the kitchen (that's not actually that common)! You can tell there is great pride in what they prepare and serve, and all is house made, including their insane-o house vinaigrette.
Now about that tiramisu: also house made, and they do something I think is kind of amazing, but maybe it's just me; they freeze it, but because of the liquor it only soft freezes, so when they serve it to you, it's this cold, creamy, boozy, delicious slice of heaven. They aren't freezing it for storage folks, they're freezing it so that this amazing thing happens to it and you become addicted and keep coming back for more.
I guess I should discuss the pastas too?
Delish. Perfectly sauced, al dente, not bogged down in garlic, which is a nice change of pace. There's not a whole lot worse than having to take a handful of Tums after eating Italian because it's like you ate a whole bulb of garlic.

The pizza was really good. I am notorious for not eating my crust and ate most of the crust on the three slices I had. We got two very large pizzas for the table, a caprese salad as a starter, and then a couple people got their own thing. These pizzas are no joke. They are quite large, fully loaded with the toppings you order, and taste delicious. The caprese salad also tasted really fresh! I could not get enough of everything, including the tomatoes!

As for the food, we ordered their meat combo and oyster pizza; Yes oysters! We had to try it, and I was skeptical.
First off the meat combo...it was great, there was a ton of cheese and a well balance of meat along with mushrooms. I thought the crust was crisp and overall there was some really nice flavor.
Now with the oyster...hmm, well it was good! They didn't put a lot of oysters, and they were chopped into smaller pieces, so overall not a big seafood flavor which I liked for a pizza. Overall very similar in build to the combo and nice to try. I prob would not order again, as I'm more of a traditional meat pizza.
As for the bar, I'm not sure if they are owned together or just partnered. I ordered an old fashion, and it was good but not great. I should have specified my liquor of choice, so I'm not sure what it was made with, though it seemed a bit watery and lacking in flavor.

But they didn't have a nondairy cheese option, so I wasn't able to order pizza which I'd been craving b/c I'm no-dairy/vegan. They could widen their customer base if they just offered one nondairy option for all the lactose intolerant and vegan people. But my friend had one of their regular dairy veggie pizzas and thought it was pretty good. A nice thick crust on it, looked loaded and perfectly cooked to me.
I personally liked the atmosphere. There were plenty of comfortable booths and the place was painted and decorated thoughtfully in unique classy colors with interesting wall art, giving it a sort of antique Romanesque feel--not your average pizza joint slapped together. It's connected to Harry's Bar inside, where you can walk back and forth between the two, and the bar is classy too. A soothing place with AC in hot summer in this mainly old non-AC area of town. And--if you happen to like being hot in summer, hey there's outdoor seating where you can roast away!
The pizza was ready exactly on time when we called ahead, served by a super friendly guy with a smile and a great sense of humor. This was during non-peak hours, so maybe that helped.

First thing we noticed, the Excellent food rating on the door...my husband loves this! Before Washington started this law, he visited New York, where this was ALREADY law and loved seeing the ratings on the door...made it easy to choose which ones to go into and which ones to avoid! Wasn't busy at all, they had just opened up, so we had our pick of the litter. Choose a booth by the window! Restaurant is very clean, not run down, but not brand new, but had a ""homey"" feel to it! We were welcomed by a very nice lady that had a very thick Greek accent! I ordered the manicotti with meat sauce, & a salad, hubs had the chicken parmesan sandwich with a cup of soup!
We get our order, my husband takes a bite looks at me, closes his eyes and says ""don't talk to me for a minute""....I know what that means! he said it was one of IF NOT the best sandwiches he has ever had! Chicken was seasoned perfectly, good sauce, but it was the bread that did it...lightly toasted inside and nice a spongy soft on the outside, but not soggy...HE LOVED IT !!
My manicotti was great, cheese was flavored good (some restaurants the ricotta is just bland, not this case) Piping hot and delicious! My salad was awesome as well...crisp lettuce with tomatoes, cucumbers, olives with mozzarella cheese and tons of blue cheese dressing!

I recently tried the chicken parmesan and wasn't all that impressed. The portion was large and it looked great. I'm told by my co-worker that it must have been an off day because it's usually a lot better. He got it too. The chicken was tough and had some gristle throughout. The meat was lukewarm too, as if it had been taken out of the fridge prior to warming it up and serving it on top of the spaghetti.

Saw this joint on the maps and it had good ratings. So we went down and gave it shot.
So we walked in and waited for the host to be seated.
We sat down and was checking out the menu, the prices are unbelievably high. Now I live in Los Angeles and prices are not even that high for pizza or pasta, unless it's a fancy restaurant. But even tho, it wasn't that expensive.
But if it's an expensive place it better be worth it. But nope!!
Ordered a pesto chicken fettuccine.
This pasta was drench in a watery pesto sauce.
It was basically like im eating fucking ramen noodles with green food coloring soup.
It had :
No Flavor
Not enough cheese
Pasta was hard
And there chicken was watery and felt expired!!!!!
I myself had to add allot of parmesan and chili peppers for it to taste better. But the watery sauce was taking out the flavor.
But no way I couldn't waste it. I finished my damn food ""ONLY CAUSE I DID NOT WANNA WASTE $20 ON A FUCKING PASTA !

Cute little space in the heart of Columbia City. They have a great lunch and happy hour, I'd recommend coming during those times. Server was great. They were out of a couple of items, but it was right after the holiday so I can't complain too much.
FOODWe went with the Salerno, which is a great light salad for the table. The basil is super fresh and the buffalo mozzarella is a familiar but new taste/consistency for the dish. No complaints with this one.
For pies, we went with the Prosciutto e Funghi, which was a great red sauce pizza. They don't skimp out on the prosciutto! This one was really good too, it was everything I'd expect from a red sauce prosciutto pizza. Salty, and a great crust.
The second pie was the Roberto. This used the buffalo mozzarella again, and also a pistachio puree for the sauce. I've never really had a pizza like this, but I loved this one. It wasn't too heavy, and the ingredients all just seemed to work well together.

Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria - Columbia City,(206) 721-3501,"Matt L.
Boston, MA","Overall: my rating is around a 3.5 but I rounded down since our service was somewhat of a frustrating experience.
We came in around 5 PM on a Saturday, not knowing that they have happy hour going on. There's select appetizers and all pizzas (10"" and 13"") that are on the happy hour menu from 3-6 and 9-close.
We ordered bruschetta, the misto salad, carbonara, Bolognase, gnocchi with sausage, and Leonardo pizza (for a party of 5 with leftovers). All of the dishes were pretty good. My dish (the carbonara) was great as it was not creamy but rather dry which makes me not feel as bad eating it. I think I would recommend ordering this dish or the gnocchi if considering a pasta dish!
Even though I enjoyed my food, our server was not the best as he neglected some of our requests and had to be reminded at least 3 times for simple things. They seemed well staffed so I don't think the ""busy-ness"" of the restaurant was a main factor. After taking our orders with one of us requesting spaghetti vongole, all of our dishes came out and our server told us he didn't realize that they were out of clams. Okay, it would have been nice if he told us earlier rather than when all of the food came out as this person didn't have anything to eat while she had to figure out what to order now and then have to wait for it to be cooked.
Another thing was that when clearing our dishes, he didn't seem like he was paying attention and he dropped a couple knives on my hand (luckily it was not sharp and no cuts or exposures were noted). All he said was ""oh sorry, some of the utensils are slippery"" then laughed and walked away. We also asked for a bag for our take away boxes three times and he kept forgetting so I got tired and I got up and asked another waiter myself for it and he was happy to assist. I don't know if our waiter started getting embarrassed or tired serving us since he saw me get someone else but I can tell he was not all there tonight so my experience regarding service was not the best.
Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back since the food was good but hopefully we get another waiter....",,,

For apps, we ordered the marinated beets which is on the HH menu. The dish consists of roasted beets, red onion, pistachio, goat cheese, and red wine vinaigrette. It is such a light and refreshing dish that I recommend ordering before pizza. We also ordered the clam dish off the HH menu which I highly recommend. The tomato sauce is super flavorful and taste so good with toasted bread. I love how the clams tasted fresh and each shell had a clam inside.
For pizzas, we ordered the Leornardo (tomato sauce, italian sausage, roasted red pepper, calabrian chile, roasted onion, fresh mozzarella, provola and oregano) and Capricciosa (tomato sauce, ham, artichoke, mushroom, kalamata olive, fresh mozzarella, and basil). The pizza are thin crust pizza baked in a wood-fire oven. My favorite is the Leornardo between the two. It is more flavorful and you can't go wrong with ingredients.

They do have pasta and meat options, but the selection is pretty scarce. I was only interested by 1 pasta option and none of the pizzas, but I liked what I ordered enough to have a good meal.
I had the bruschetta, neopolitan meatballs, and the gnocchi with braised beef. If you asked me to choose anything else on the menu I'd have a hard time doing so. The food I did order was great though. The bruschetta and meatballs was an absolutely perfect combo. The potato gnocchi was very tasty, although a bit saltier than it should have been.
The service here was fast and attentive. Came a few minutes past happy hour but they still gave us happy hour prices. It was a pretty busy place on a friday evening though so plan accordingly.
Overall, if you're in the area and want Italian food, this is a good choice. But if you're like me and want pasta but not pizza, look elsewhere. Definitely wish there were more pasta options.",,,

They also have other food options, and drink specials. They always have a red, white, and rose wine, beer, and cocktails on the HH menu, which allows everyone to have what they are craving.
We always sit at the bar when we visit and have had great service and attentive staff.",,,

With that being said, my friends and I came here for a girls' night and it was actually the perfect setting and lively ambiance for the occasion.
Bruschetta was lovely, pizza cooked thinly and salad was my unexpected favorite of the night. And that tiramisu for dessert.. truly unbeatable!
We also had great service. I'd love to return.",,,

Jackson, MS","this restaurant is for a lot of people, but i don't think it's really for me. i'm open to try this place again but i'm sad that the food and i weren't as compatible as i was hoping to be, so heart broken.
i came here to catch up with some high school friends & had always seen this restaurant but never visited! anyways, the ambience was nice & a bit nicer than casual. this is a cute italian restaurant with a great wine list, they do the fire wood pizza so you are greeted with a huge wood stove oven in the background when you walk in.
there was three of us, so we split two pizzas. we got the leonardo & the bianca. i also ordered a glass of wine, i got the etna rossa which was the highlight of my night.
here's the thing about the pizza, it was not terrible at ALL! it just didn't excite me, it was decent but something about it was just not satisfying. maybe the style of pizza is too fancy for me but yeah, in my personal opinion my experience was missing something.
for dessert: the tiramisu was delicious though! was happy that we topped off our visit with this
lovely waitress, lovely vibes in the restaurant just not really into the food. my friends love it though so that makes me feel better about this review",,,

Kent, WA","Came to this place once before but forgot to make a review prior.
This place was once not very popular (as their happy hour was not well known). The pizza and salad are very good, handmade, and mouthwatering. Though even on Sunday's this place is packed to the beams, which makes the service slow and sometimes frustrating, however one has to keep in mind that you are getting your money's worth. This place is a nice treat, offering a good location and ambience with light decor as well as ample artificial and natural light, with colors that help make the food pop. Although one gripe is in a sunny day, which Seattle rarely gets in the winter months, make sure to avoid the windows or else you'll be blinded by the bright sunlight even with the shades drawn. Thoroughly enjoy this restaurant and highly recommend it!",,,

Seattle, WA","We're loyal Tutta Bella customers but this last visit was nothing short of disastrous. We came in around 5:15PM when it wasn't terribly busy. We had to wait forever just to get menus. Once we placed orders for our drinks and an appetizer (our go-to ciabatta and stracciatella), it was an absurdly long wait to get our food and drinks. Given that it wasn't that crowded when we placed our orders, and neither our drinks nor appetizer should have taken more than a minute to prep, this was inexcusable.
When we finally received our drinks and appetizer, we tried placing our order to go. We attempted to order their seasonal gnocchi and their lasagne, and were informed the lasagne was already sold out for the evening. The server told us that they only made eight lasagnes per night, which is ridiculous to have a menu item that sells out THAT early prior to closing. We modified our order and, again, waited and waited.
While we waited for our to-go order, we asked for a second round of drinks. Our server seemingly forgot, and ten minutes later, we had to remind her about our drinks. Several minutes later we were brought our drinks, but our food was nowhere in sight. Finally, about an hour and a half after we arrived, we finally got our food.
Stupidly, I didn't check the order before leaving. When I got home, I opened the box to find the most pitiful portion of gnocchi. It looked like a child's portion of pasta. Seriously, for $18+, I'd expect a normal sized portion of pasta. And, it was just average at best. Three tiny pieces of beef, and the gnocchi was on the overcooked, mushy side.
What gives, Tutta Bella? You used to be so good. This has me questioning whether I'll be back, particularly to this location.",,,

Bothell, WA","This restaurant is a neighborhood away from my boyfriends place and he's been mentioning how great their pizzas are. One night, we were finally able to try it out together! I can't quite remember exactly which pizza this was but it was good. The pizza stood out, as it was loaded, flavorful and had a great texture to its crust, not too thick and not too thin. The Napoli salad was delicious and had lots of toppings. I think the spaghetti alle vongoli was nicely made; however, I feel like there could have been something more to it. Perhaps more clam and sauce. The burrata with peppernata was a bit too oily but tasty nonetheless. Ordering to go via phone was timely and order was accurate. Def stop in for the pizza and salad.",,,

Kingston, WA","I love Tutta Bella pizza. I've been to the location in Columbia City and the one up North in Wallingford.
The pizza is always very consistent. When I first tried Tutta Bella I was surprised that there was no pepperoni on the menu. But then I got a real education Nepolitan pizza and the making to those standards.
Very thin crust, perfectly chewy but not all doughy.
Not too heavy on the sauce but just the right amount, and just a hint of sweetness.
They have ready made choices or build your own. I like prosciutto and arugula with red sauce.
It takes less than 5 minutes for pizzas to cook in that super high heat. You don't have to wait very long to get a very delicious and filling pizza.
They have some delicious sides, salads, and a few other items such as gelato. All are good.
This place will make me come off of my low carb lifestyle if I were close enough to go there as I used to be up until a few years ago.
For those of you who love pizza, and can consume carbs, I highly recommend that you give to to Bella a chance. I would love to hear your comparison to other pizza places, especially any others certified Neopolitan.",,,

Seattle, WA","Tutta Bella has one of my favorite happy hours in Seattle. Pizzas are only $10, which is a great deal. I'm not usual a big pizza fan, but I can get on board with Tutta Bella because their pizzas are like what you find in Europe. If you're hungry, or with a hungry person, you should each get your own. If you just want a snack, you're fine to share. I love the white pizza. My husband was skeptical of it because he loves tomato sauce but once he tried some he basically ate it all. They also have gelato, which I am very interested in trying, I just haven't gotten around to it yet The service is great and it's on the charming Columbia City main strip. I'd definitely recommend this as a place for getting together with friends or going out as a family. I also see people with to-go orders from here all the time. Street parking only, FYI.",,,

The red sauce has almost no seasoning - tastes out of a can or for people scared of garlic and salt. Enjoyed the ceasar add anchovies though! And service was great.",,,

Freaking noisy as hell. Would not bring a date here or have a business meal here. The concrete floor and walls with the people packed in really made it hard to hear. The waitress wouldn't raise her voice so I had to ask my friend to repeat everything she said.
I had the meatball and ricotta pizza which had the perfect balance of cheese and meat. The crust was just all right. It was on the thinner side; I like a doughier/thicker crust on my pizza. I also had the chocolate panacotta which was delicious!
Friends had the bianca pizza and mediterranean pizza. They said they were great. One friend got their espresso served with a chocolate gelato, and she reported it was a divine combo and a jolt of caffeine.
The bathroom was clean, thank goodness.

Last week we had a Canadian bacon, mushroom & black olive calzone that knocked our socks off. It was served with a small side salad that we saved for the next day. We added a full size Greek salad to our dinner order. It was wonderful. Tons of feta cheese. Only change I would make is cut cucumbers & tomatoes into smaller pieces. And we had leftovers of that for next day too.
During these corona virus times I noticed all the work they were doing to keep us safe. One cup with clean pens for signing receipt and one for dirties. All staff wearing gloves. Door handles inside & out cleaned between guests. I waited in my car outside til I saw previous guest come out.

Seattle, WA","I came here to try the Philly cheesesteak sandwich. My friend summed it up perfectly when he said, ""I can't tell if that's supposed to be ground beef or Italian sausage."" Steak, it's supposed to be steak. And when your steak tastes like a cross between ground beef and Italian sausage, that's a problem.
All of the cheese had melted off to one side of the sandwich. You couldn't taste the peppers or onions at all. The bread was super hard and crusty.
I didn't want the salad that was supposed to come with it. I didn't think to ask if I could substitute anything for it. I was kind of annoyed about paying $16.75 for a single sandwich, but that's partially my own fault.
The Philly cheesesteak here might be somebody's idea of a good sandwich, but it's definitely not what I was looking for.",,,

We decided to sit at the bar you can tell it's very much a neighborhood go to we saw a family come in to get their mason jar of salad dressing by the interaction with the staff they seem to stop by often. The bartender who was also our server snd the main dining room was friendly.
They're in the middle of construction on the space next door which will be their bar instead of the small space they currently have in the restaurant but it's not disruptive at all you wouldn't even know.
One of the drink specials was Deep Eddy Pomegranate with I asked if I could have Ruby Red instead of the the Pomegranate and it was not a problem. I was pleasantly surprised when we received or drinks in highballs and even more so when I saw it only cost $7 a piece.
We were going to go with a couple of appetizers but decided to split a sandwich and the fried mozzarella instead pretty sure the sticks were house-made by the way they were coated We had the $15 Unconventional BLT: Bacon, Canadian-style bacon, chipotle mayo & mozzarella on French bread served up hot & finished with fresh, crisp lettuce & tomatoes. He brought is the salad split which was still generous servings per person. When he brought the sandwich out he have us a couple of smaller plate. the sandwich was gigantic so glad we split it we actually couldn't eat all of our halves. Bothe the mozzarella sticks and the sandwich came out piping hot. Anyone who knows me, knows I hate it when food comes out like it's been sitting around for awhile.

We ordered a bunch of food - large pizza and two dishes between the two of us for take out. The person on the phone needed me to repeat the order many times. Maybe she was distracted. She was nice overall. She said it would be ready in 20 minutes but it was more like 30-40 minutes.
The eggplant parmesan was mealy in its consistency. The chicken parmesan wasn't much better. It came with two little spaghettis, which we didn't need and didn't taste great. The side salad had a ton of cheese on it that I ended up taking off and feeding it to my dog for the week. The pizza was too greasy, salty and cheesy. The food overall was too salty and cheesy. We like salt and cheese but this was too much for us. I think with a little tweaking the place could do better.

The shrimp and calzone are also delicious and made well.
I would recommend this place for date night with your significant other or family and friends. The environment is perfect for romantic evenings and again or family.

East Chastain Park, Atlanta, GA","For reference purposes, I ordered a small BBQ pizza and the hot wings. These are items that I have ordered hundreds of times across the US throughout my years of business travels and this was by far the worst pizza and wings I have ever eaten. The hot wings were burnt and so dry that I could only compare them to what I would guess dog food to taste like. As for the BBQ pizza, it felt and tasted like a mash of non-identifiable ingredients with a sickly sweet after taste. Obviously, others have had good experiences with this restaurant based on their other reviews which is why I ordered from them but I cannot imagine those positive reviewers received the same items that I did, made the same way.

Wow- what a great spot to visit! My boyfriend and I were in Seattle and were able to walk to this spot from our AirBnB so we decided to check it out. This place gets busy so I recommend getting an app that can save you a spot in line which is what we did and showed up just in time after the dinner rush had finished. The venue is extremely cute/quaint, perfect for the ultimate date night- cool signage, unique hanging lights, lots of brick bordered by wood.
We started out with the recommended wine for the evening and were very happy with the decision- I could tell they knew their stuff in that regard. We split the oven-roasted clams which were amazingly buttery but with that slight brightness that the wine and parsley added. Would have liked a little more bread with it to soak up all the amazing juices but we definitely made do. We split the formosa for dinner which is a perfect go to classic pizza that would make anyone happy- the olives were a great touch of saltiness. Finished it off with a little bit of ice cream to sooth my sweet tooth and was perfectly content.
Basically the only reason I didn't give 5 full stars is that service was a little slow towards the end of our meal despite there not being that many patrons- might have been a little short staffed?
All in all, would love to come back to Seattle to try out their other unique pizzas!",,,

The owner/manager reached out to me and was very gracious. He reviewed my concerns and was very reassuring about addressing the matter in the future. So

We were planning on only having a few slices but ended up eating the whole thing because it was so darn good!
Overall the food and service was great! The prices are on the higher end for the amount of food you get but I think it's worth it.",,,

Forest Grove, OR","I try to eat 98% plant based (""vegan"") but this certainly did not fit that category. Mioposto did not have any specifically vegan options which was a little disappointing, they did say that I could request their vegetarian pizzas without cheese, but because I was on vacation in Seattle I decided to full send the cheese. I haven't broken my veganism often (only once before) over these past 4 years, but I'd say this cheese lasagna was (maybe) worth it. The sauce however was my favorite part, so maybe they could incorporate that into a vegan dish in the future. Really great atmosphere.",,,

I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for this restaurant, but I am happy to have it in the neighborhood as an easy, go-to, kid-pleaser type of place. The food is solid. If you are low carb you can get the eggplant Parmesan (it's also gluten free), and a side salad. Otherwise, people mostly come here for the pizzas. It can be hard to bring a group larger than 4-5 because it's a fairly small restaurant, but I was able to get a large table for a party of 8 one time, on the day of Husky game no less! I actually prefer Mioposto for brunch, because they have one of the best Bloody Marys in Seattle (and a pretty good Italian style frittata).",,,

We're really patient people, no issue with waiting, but you could tell the staff was bey overwhelmed with the volume of in house and to go orders.
We watched our pizza come out of the oven, by the time it was delivered it was cold. No exaggeration, cold. The middle of the pizza had also sogged up a bit from sitting.
The pizza was delicious. I can only imagine how much I would've been raving about this place had my food been warm. We might've sent it back, but by the time someone came to see how it was, we were hungry so had already eaten quite a bit.

The calamari was SO good, the squid was so fresh and had a great taste and texture. The sauce with it was amazing, it complimented the seafood beautifully and was so impressive to me. For it being in a container steaming for about 10 minutes on the way home, the batter was still super crunchy and good. Good serving for an appetizer. My creamy pesto pasta was great, a really good portion size and I still have some left for a snack tomorrow. Lots of sauce and super flavorful. Boyfriend ordered the carbonara. He likes his pasta cooked more than they cook theirs, but he said the flavor was still awesome and it was delicious. His portioned seemed a little smaller than mine, my container was practically stuffed with food and his had quite a bit of room in the container.

When we got the bruschetta with mushrooms, first I thought it looked like dessert. But -oh-my-God what an amazing mixture of flavors and unbelievably scrumptious. I was genuinely surprised.
Seafood paella is on a pricey side, but no wonder, they took all the Finding Nemo characters and smothered them in saffron rice. Calamari, shrimp, salmon, octopus, 2 types of mussels, Italian sausage and chicken!! No, not chicken of the sea, the bawk bawk kind.
Absolutely lovely place downtown Renton.
Pros:
-Delicious food
- Excellent service (what a character Cristian has, I have no idea how he keeps it up entire evening, great work!)
- Romantic and inviting ambiance
Cons:
- Nothing obvious :)

London, United Kingdom","Enjoyed a lively dinner with friends here. We were entertained by our server who was a charming man with large gestures and a fun attitude. He was a nice distraction from the long wait we had between ordering drinks and again when we waited to be served our entrees.
The highlights were the dishes at a reasonable price except for the specials. Fried calamari starter was excellent as was the Caesar salad. I really enjoyed the linguini vongole, a good portion of clams in a tasty garlic butter sauce. My friend enjoyed the giant serving of seafood paella customized to her liking. For dessert would recommend the spumoni gelato or tiramisu. Excellent flavor!
The lowlights were the spaghetti carbonara. Having had this dish in Italy I can say there was not enough creamy egg yolk. It was dry and the only saving grace was the generous amount of pancetta in it. The chocolate fudge cake was extremely rich and not a hit with everyone that tried it. Don't let them try to tell you otherwise. Lastly their wine list is expensive! Local wines will set you back $40 at a minimum.
Overall a great meal at a decent price for most items. Friendly service and a nice atmosphere where you could bring a date or friends. I would definitely return.",,,

Gotta give credit where it's due - the prices are very reasonable and the staff is very nice.
Overall, I thought the food was just average, but perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes.
The Good: The bellini and the parmesan truffle fries. (How can you go wrong with truffle fries? yum!)
The Okay: The chopped salad was okay. It barely had any chickpeas or salami, so it felt like I was just eating the greens. Vinaigrette was good though.
The Bad: When going to an italian restaurant for the first time, I almost always order the lasagna because it's a basic italian dish that most restaurants can get right. For me, though, Marianna did not get this right. It was very basic with not many flavors. It honestly looked and tasted as if Chef Boyardee himself was in the back putting this dish together.
This was a forgettable meal, but I might be back at a later date to give it another try since I'm trying to support local Renton businesses. I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again though.",,,

I ordered one of the specials, the paella. This came with an incredible amount of delicious seafood--it could easily have fed two. There was a full piece of salmon that was perfectly cooked. There were a few crab legs that were nice and fresh. The shrimp were nice and large. Then there was also lots of mussels and clams along with calamari.

I just moved to the area and this was my first time trying this restaurant because my granny wanted it. She usually gets the spaghetti and meatballs but she wanted to get a lasagna with me. Both of us didn't like it. The reason why it's a 2 star instead on 1 is because of the guy with the loud voice and funny personality that greeted me, his personality alone made me want to eat inside instead of pick up.

Amazingly enough, everything we ordered was really tasty.
The calamari was just a little too greasy, but had great flavor and texture. I really loved the green aioli sauce that came with it. Even the complimentary bread was nice, and went well with the olive oil herb mixture.
For entrees, we got the lobster Ravioli Aurora, King Salmon Piccata special, and the spaghetti carbonara. For drinks, we had the Bella Donna. Each entree was actually delicious. My favorite was the huge portion of spaghetti carbonara. It was heavy with cream, and had a good portion of pancetta.
For dessert, we ordered tiramisu. The cake had some liqueur in it, but neither the alcohol nor the cream was overpowering. It was really well balanced.
We only had one issue; although delicious, the king salmon was undercooked. I'm sure the cook would have made it right if we had pointed it out to the waitress, but we just decided to take it to go and cook it more at home.
I'm giving 5 stars for the quality of food and for the fact that our waitress gave us a free birthday dessert and also honored the yelp check-in coupon for $10 off. It was really great service.",,,

Seattle, WA","Don't usually bother to write bad reviews but this is an exception. Back on Valentine's day I got a rock about two inches around served in my very expensive seafood dish. Made server aware of it, and they acted like it was no big deal. ""Oh that happens sometimes."" Fortunate for all parties concerned I didn't bite down on it. Food was ok. Didn't make a fuss because it's Valentine's and didn't want to ruin the mood.
Fast forward last week, go to the bar, order a dirty martini. Served with no olive juice. Asked why. They were out. How are you going to serve a drink without all the ingredients? And you knew you were out. Was then charged $14 for the one drink. Between the two that's enough for me not to go back and post this as a warning to would be restaurant goers.

They have a great wine list--I ordered a great Walla Walla Vinters Cuvee. I started with the trio of spreads--hummus, labneh, and baba ghanoush. This was served with warm pita. All the spreads were great, but my favorite was probably the hummus. They all had really good flavor.
Next was the saffron chicken. This was absolutely delicious and the sauce was incredible. The chicken was cooked perfectly. I ordered some extra pita bread just to be able to sop up the saffron sauce it was so good.
Next, I had some of the garlic green beans. The beans were really fresh and the garlic was not overpowering.

Seattle, WA","So impressed! And I don't give 5 stars lightly (especially in seattle).
Food: for our Friday date night, hubby and I ordered four dishes to share: kale salad (sub mixed greens and goat cheese), tiger prawns, 1/2 fig and pancetta pizza and 1/2 lamb and goat cheese pizza, lamb shank entree. Everything came out one by one and we had the most amazing slow dinner. The salad was unexpectedly delicious! The dressing is low key crack in the best of ways. The prawns were cooked in a butter sauce and while delicious, it was $17 for 5 which seemed a touch overpriced. Moving on to the star of the night - the pizzas. The lamb one had a spicy kick and was amazing but what was even better was the fig and pancetta. I mean GOTDAMN. The flavors were so unique, yet everything worked flawlessly together. And the dough. My, my, my... the dough is something worthy of praise all on its own. Lastly came the lamb shank which was HUGE and tender. This is my fave restaurant in seattle hands down.
Atmosphere: very date night chic. Dimly lit. Real candles on the tables. Very pretty chandeliers.
Service: everyone was so freaking friendly - from the hostess (who we later found out was the owner) to the servers - so nice and funny!

Seattle, WA","Prosciutto de Parma Pizza $19: I got hit with a craving for prosciutto pizza on my way home from work, so decided to try this place for takeout. My pizza took about 15 minutes. I measured it when when I got home and it's not a perfect circle, but it was about 10 inches in diameter. My appetite is generally on the smaller side, but I was full after eating this on my own. It wasn't the best prosciutto pizza I've had (that is still Archive Bar & Kitchen in San Francisco) but it was good enough and hit the spot. I didn't taste the olive oil on it, so at home I did dip the crust in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
I do want to come try to dine in sometime to try other items and their yummy looking cocktails!
Update: I have since returned to dine in for a date night and had a great time!
The Phoenician $14: Really likes this drink, it had the right amount of tartness. It went down so easy I could have drank it in one gulp but forced myself to make it last throughout dinner.
Nightshade $13: I normally don't like the drinks my boyfriend orders because the alcohol is too strong for me, but I didn't mind this one! Still not something I would order for myself, but it was pretty smooth.
Burrata $17: A tasty appetizer. The grilled bread was so good! Buttery and the perfect texture to enjoy with the cheese.
Lamb Chop Lollipops $16: The first bite was good and I could taste that garlic-y butter. After that, I either got used to the flavor or it faded because it was a little bit on the bland side. Texture was good, but I personally felt it was missing a tiny pinch of salt.
The Alki $19: The crust was good like last time. Crispy but not burnt. The right amount of chewiness. I did request oil and balsamic vinegar at the restaurant to dip the crust. Flavor wise I would pick the Prosciutto de Parma over this one. I do eventually want to try their pepperoni and Margherita pizza as well.
Tiramisu Cocktail $13: It reminded me of a White Russian, and I love those!
Nutella Cheesecake $9: I'm normally not into chocolate cheesecakes or cakes because I find them too rich. I was willing to give this a try because Nutella and it was tasty! The cheesecake was dense but not overwhelmingly sweet. I didn't really taste any hint of biscotti liquor in the whipped cream though.
Turkish Affogato $8: The coffee comes on the side so you can pour it over yourself. We accidentally put too much coffee on it so the ice cream melted pretty quickly. There was still enough coffee leftover after that to drink some on its own, so it's almost a 2 for 1 deal.

On this visit we sat at a high top table between the bar and the dining room seating. This was a nice location and we felt like we were in a good place to laugh and be loud without bothering anyone.
We ordered the Saffron Chicken and Burratta as appetizers and the sauce on the chicken was so good that I was putting it on the crustini from the cheese! Absolutely great flavor. Both appetizers were a good size for sharing but def left you wanting more.
We ordered two pizzas to go along with our two bottles of wine as well. The Fig and Pancetta Pizza was awesome. I love how the crust is both crispy and chewy and the flavors meshed together well.

The fig salad may look small but it is not to be messed with. Super flavorful and we demolished it in seconds. The figs were juicy and went so well with the arugula.
The pizza was also pretty good- you can't mess up pizza. But really the star of the show was the lamb shank. With a hefty price tag- I cannot emphasize how great this dish was. Our waiter told us that the lamb shank is the only thing the original owner still makes and man is it good. The meat just falls off the bone. It's so flavorful and juicy and overall drool worthy.
The cocktails were really good as well! Very refreshing. The waiters have a good idea of what to recommend to you so I wold go with that.

It's ambiance is dimly lit, suave, and perfect for a date night. The service is great and everyone was extremely warm and welcoming, and the cocktails were tasty.
On the food front (the whole reason we came), was where I was disappointed. Simply put - the food is overpriced for what it is. The trio of dips was alright, and the labneh was the standout from a pretty standard lineup. The garlic green beans were the most surprising example of how overpriced I believe the food to be here. The pizza was good, although not memorable compared to other slices you can get even a few blocks down in West Seattle.

Seattle, WA","After waiting for a new location to open and since they had great reviews at their old location, my wife was eagerly waiting. Living in the Junction and being a block away, we really wanted to like it. Unfortunately we were both very disappointed.
The menu is definitely limited, we ordered the small plates and a Pizza.
I think if you are a Lebanese restaurant the hummus plate should be free or less expensive they served 6 small slices of Pita with 3 little dips $13.00 then ordered the lamb chops one bite for each with no flavor.They do not have a happy hour so the average drinks are $14.00 and small, Beer is a 12oz glass not even a pint as mostly all restaurants in Junction serve, Entrees are all $$$$ no choices and small portions.
So we ordered a Pizza and compared to other places in the junction the pizza has a lot to be desired.
We asked the server for a box for 3 slices of pizza and the bill and we were in shocked when he returned with a black (doggie) bag and the pizza wrapped in foil paper, for the amount they charged on the Entrees and the fine dinning they advertised they can afford a simple box for customer to take their leftovers.It looked like a dog Poop bag!!!.

The service was also fantastic! Our server was Jeffrey and he was helpful, fun, and provided the perfect amount of attention - I'd hope to have him as my server again.

What a gem in the heart of west Seattle. It's located at the old alchemy. When you walk in you are immediately greeted by a group of very friendly staff member, this was the first time I came here and I immediately felt like I was a regular. The food was all amazing, we started with the fiery scallops and burrata- both were amazing. I am typically skeptical about pizza at small plates restaurants, but was pleasantly surprised. The crust was baked with a crispy exterior and a nice warm fluffy interior and the toppings were all cooked to perfection. We finished our meal with a light and fragrant Turkish affogato and my girlfriend had super crispy and fluffy baklava served with rose ice cream.
I will definitely be returning here again very soon. Without a doubt this restaurant has earn a spot in my heart as one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Washington State.",,,

When I moved from VA to Seattle couple of years back, I was looking for a local place that can offer friendly and professional staff with really homemade delicious food. I became a fan once I tried their food and pizza. Nadia always made me feel at home with her beautiful smile and wonderful service. Few months ago we went to the old address across from Alki beach and it was closed. I was so disappointed. I'm happy to say they Re-opened the brand new restaurant at new address 4717 42nd Avenue SW, west Seattle. I am going to try the new location very soon I have heard it's going strong with even better selection-cannot wait! This became a place of distinct flavors, experiences and memories for me since I have been here in Seattle.
The best part about the experience, in addition to the fresh and deliciously prepared food, is the family that owns the restaurant. They have a special gift and make you feel like you are part of their family. This is what makes Phoenicia truly extraordinary and like no other place in the junction or West Seattle.
I had the safron chicken and artesian pizza's, such as butternut squash; fiery lamb and ch猫vre; and my favorite truffle oil and mushrooms. Also try their handcrafted cocktails. You won't be disappointed.",,,

There's limited space to eat inside, so plan to get your food to go! My favorite sandwich is hands-down the Turkey Pastrami Panini, although I have also fallen victim to the Spinach Delish Crepe or the Breakfast bagel. If you're eyeing up something sweet, I highly recommend the Nutella Crepe or Carrot Cake, as well as a quintessential go-to Chai Latte.

Bad Service!!
3rd Visit ... I'm so bummed I really liked this place but they have a serving problem. I originally gave this place a five star but on my second visit did not receive any service it was as if the serving staff were in a fight and no one was going to wait on this one table which is where we were seated. Definitely one of the most awkward visits to a restaurant ever. We waited so long we eventually had to excuse ourselves and leave with no service no one even tried to stop us to apologize. This was my husband's birthday. Prices these days are so high you can't risk inconsistency. I'll leave my original review below.

Seattle, WA","Food was pretty good, but service is terrible. Both times I've been here the service has been awful.
The first time I went, we ordered 10 minutes before happy hour. Instead of the server telling us HH started in ten minutes, he made sure we ordered prior so we'd have to pay full price.
The second time I went with a larger party. Anytime we'd ask for something (like a photo or a candle in the dessert) the waitress would act annoyed like we were wasting her time.
If service were better I'd give this place a 3.5. They have a few really good pizzas, but they're salads aren't anything special.",,,

Of benefit is their location. A nice brick building that is the last restaurant heading North on California. It's well decorated and has a nice ambience inside including a large glimmering painting of horses on the wall. (I think one of the horses is missing a leg.)
I like meat so the Pinocchio is the pizza for me. The crust is crisp yeasty with a light sweetness. When I'm in for cheese, I love the Quattro Formaggi with milled tomatoes. I don't like clams here as much as some of my friends do as I prefer a red sauce with my bivalves. The lasagna is quite good. Baked in the same brick oven as the pizza.
Service has been solid.",,,

Seattle, WA","Finally able to dine at Mioposto after a couple failed attempts due to my impatience of not wanting to wait for over 1 hour for a table, I was really pleased!
A friend chose Mioposto to celebrate her birthday. A couple of us got together with her. We shared their antipasti plate of goat cheese, olive tapenade, agro dolce, roasted and marinated eggplant, prosciutto and arugula with bread. The cheese was really good and the prosciutto was perfection. I got the lamb pizza, which comes with onion, goat cheese (had a lot of goat cheese that night), roasted red peppers and mint. I really liked the lamb; I ended up picking off the peppers. The mozzarella was divine. A friend got a pepperoni pie while the other ordered lasagna. The person who ordered the pepperoni commented that the crust was a bit burnt but frankly I think he wasn't use to a wood fired crust; it didn't look burnt to me but I wasn't eating it either.
The server offered a free dessert to the birthday girl, so she got tiramisu and loved it. I ordered their apple crostada and asked for the vanilla ice cream to be on the side because it was freezing cold in there. As soon as I ordered it that way, I realized how illogical that was. Go figure.
Mioposto is decorated in a really pleasing way. It's a small dining area with a couple booths, a few tables and a long communal table in the center. Their bar has sports going but not loudly. The lighting is cool. There's a giant horse mural on one wall that is pretty sweet.
Parking in this neighborhood sucks, but that is West Seattle for you. If you can't find a spot on the street, because there is no lot here, drive up the road to Safeway and park there then walk a couple blocks.
Our waiter/server was also that night's bartender. He kept good tabs on us even though he was wearing multiple hats.

Junction, Seattle, WA","Man, I love Mioposto for dinner but brunch was incredible. Honestly can't believe how blown away we were by the food. We love their pizza and the brunch options were just perfect. Morning service was a little hectic (one server) but she was super friendly and helpful.
We got the Stromboli (basically a margherita pizza with eggs, caramelized onions and potato folded in half). It was delicious, I think it could have used a bit more sauce but it wasn't dry by any means. It wasn't overwhelming salty or anything, a bit on the blander side but still good. My favorite was the pananata (chopped up French toast topped with apple cinnamon and powdered sugar). It was SO GOOD. I know at some point I'll have to use other words but words are escaping me. It wasn't too sweet, but sweet enough that I didn't need syrup. I literally ate the whole plate because despite my gf saying it was good, she isn't a huge fan of sweets....and I tried to tell myself to not eat it all but my self control isn't too strong.
We opted for no pancetta and they didn't have any subs but it was fine. Also ordered a coffee and a side of hashbrowns (gf said hashbrowns were really good).
Price point was good. Not expensive at all and super affordable. Our new favorite brunch spot and right down the street!",,,

Seattle, WA","After going to Mioposto in Mt. Baker, we gave the Alki location a try (it was closer to where we were staying anyways). It was also a good option, although the Mt. Baker location is in a way better setting. This one was at least not in the busy downtown Alki area, so parking was easier than we expected (but still took a bit of searching).
We ordered similar items as what we had at the Mt. Baker location (I got the beet salad, margarita pizza but I added mushrooms this time, and WA red blend; my husband got the caesar, pepperoni pizza with prosciutto on the side, but tried a medium colored nitro beer). The food was relatively consistent; something about the beet salad at the Mt. Baker location was better (I think the almonds were more finely ground and there were more beets). We also had to get normal size pizzas since we missed the timeframe for the salad/pizza special, and those were nice. I forgot to order extra crispy, so I highly recommend doing that (makes it well done all the way through - definitely way better!). The basil on my pizza was not shredded like at the other location, totally minor, but I wasn't as big of a fan of that. Also, the mushroom topping is called a ""mushroom trio,"" and it was actually just one kind of mushroom (crimini). Again nothing super big, but just a little confusing as ""trio"" means ""three."" My husband loved the nitro beer and said it was super smooth (I apologize for not remembering the exact name, but it was a medium brown and not hoppy at all).
The service wasn't as great as Mt. Baker. It might have been the time we were there (late 3's/early 4's). Our waitress was busy doing other things (appeared to be prepping for the dinner crowds), so there were long periods of waiting. We didn't mind since we were just relaxing. Eventually another waiter took over. Not the same attentiveness as the other location, but still not bad.
At the end of the day, the food was still great. If I had the opportunity to choose between the different locations, I think it's obvious what my pick is (Mt. Baker), but again, this location isn't bad.",,,

While the pizza was fine, the greens in my beet salad were so slimy. The salad had definitely been made far ahead of my ordering it. The music they were playing incredibly dorky & soft, almost Christian sounding pop. (According to Shazam, one of the bands was called The Script?) Unfortunately, it got on my nerves so badly, I had a panic attack. My brain chemistry is NOT their fault, but throughout the meal, we were both so completely turned off by the music. Why not just play some whatever downtempo instead of something some customers would find obnoxious? In all of the years I've been eating there (primarily at the one in Mount Baker), I've never heard anything like it. Imagine the soundtrack from a Hallmark movie.

Seattle, WA","I have been wanting to try this spot, but let's be honest: I'm fiercely loyal to a few other pizza places nearby. A dear friend is a big fan, though, so on New Years we decided to give it a try.
We called for a reservation (highly recommend this on a busy night -- the place is tiny!) and were warmly greeted by our server / the bartender, who apologized for a short wait. When we asked about wines and told her the types of wines we like, she gladly pointed out their extensive selection of natural and raw wines, and made a recommendation. At $48, the one we tried was *outstanding* -- and affordable. We were blown away.
The appetizer we had was good, not great (the brussels sprouts -- probably because we had the pancetta on the side, for the vegetarians in the group), but the pizzas did not disappoint. We shared three pies: a regular margherita; the squash with burrata; and the funghi. I was once told you could judge the quality of a pizza place by the margherita, since you can tell the freshness of the ingredients. Holy cow, this one was stellar. It also comes out with a ramekin of fresh salt and spices, both of which enhance the flavors. The burrata pie is served hot with a massive dollop of cold burrata in the middle. The melding of flavors and temperatures was so unexpected -- and delicious.

Everything is so fresh and delicious. The kale and burrata pizza is to die for. There's seriously something mystifying that makes me salivate every time I think about it. Not only that, but the Margherita pizza is one of the best around. Margherita pizzas are usually so basic, but they've really elevated this to another level.

The good part is that the place doesn't get too crowded and it's easy to get a table outside even during busy times.
With all that, the food was the biggest disappointment for me. The pizza lacked flavor and crust was too thin. We had ordered the margarita and marinara pizza. The beer was served in wine glasses . I'll pass on this place only coz of the food.",,,

Seattle, WA","I recently came here for a Yelp Elite event and everything was fantastic. We were able to try two different wines which both were great with flavor. We were also able to try a cheese spread laid out with heirloom tomatoes and balsamic drizzle. Now the showstopper obviously were the two different pizzas we got to try. The Delux was my personal favorite. It came with sun dried tomatoes, pepperoni, sausage and goat cheese. Yum. The Burrata was also very tasty. It included a squash base with Kale, olive oil, sea salt, and burrata. Very different and unique but really quite tasty. Last but not least for dessert we were offered Tiramisu which was delicious! It had a very strong coffee flavor which I loved. This is solely a pizza and salad place so don't expect anything else. The pizza is on the smaller side for me (I could probably eat a whole one myself) but tasty.
I love the interior and the atmosphere of this place. It is a very tiny place though, there is no way you can fit more then 30 people in the restaurant but it has a very nice intimate vibe. Love all of the natural lighting and in the summer there is an option to slide open the front window to get a breeze and sit outside in the patio. The staff and owner were so pleasant I definitely would come back here again. Prices are a little toward the higher side but you're paying for the experience and the experience was out of this world.

Quality: The food is top notch. I had a Caprese Plate (not sure what it is officially called, but it has cheese, basil, and tomatoes) and a Kale and Squash Pizza. The Caprese Plate had fresh cheese that was unique and perfectly dressed with basalmic. The pizza was my favorite part, mostly because it is something I would have never ordered otherwise. Squash and kale sound awful on a pizza, but it was actually really good. The sweetness of squash balanced the bitterness of the kale perfectly. The crust was perfectly cooked and crunchy. I had the tiramisu, which was good too.
Quantity: Smaller plates, which is expected for a nice restaurant. The pizza can feed 1 if you are hungry, or 2 if neither one of you is really hungry.
Price: Apparently their happy hour pizza is only $10, which is pretty good.

Seattle, WA","Went here around the holidays and it was pretty crowded. This place is very cute inside and I love the decor. As for seating, it is extremely intimate with the tables being very close and minimal walking space.
We decided to share our food among a group of 4 and feel that we definitely got the right amount of food. We ordered a salad called ""Little Gem"" and it tasted similar to a Caesar salad, which I thought was very good and fresh tasting.
We ordered their meat charcuterie plate and I thought it was just okay. The meat is not of great quality compared to many other places in Seattle.
For pizza, we ordered the ""Piccante"" pizza, which comes with Italian salami, peppers, and mozzarella. I thought this pizza was just okay, it was too salty for my taste. We also ordered their Funghi pizza, which I liked much better. It came with olive oil and mushrooms. I thought this pizza had more flavor.
Overall, this place is very cute and intimate inside with some good food. I would come back here if I was in the area, but I wouldn't venture out of my way to come here either.",,,

We ordered bread and olive oil to start which was a true starter, the portions were small. I got margarita pizza as my entre and it was fantastic! The crust was perfectly chewy and the basil tasted so fresh. I was also pleased to see a list of spritz drinks because those are hard to find in LA. Definitely some of the best pizza I've had!",,,

Not bad at all for a place like this that's tucked in a residential area. We got the salami and sausage pizza. A tad salty and inconsistent crust (one pizza was crispy, other was less) but still made for a great meal. Will definitely be back.",,,

There are several cute outdoor tables and then of course tables inside - but only 8 or so. There is also a bar that can seat probably 6 people. The bar and inside is lovely! The owner and staff were very friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. We had three cheeses - all of which were very nice. We also had La Bianca cocktail - which normally I don't love rum drinks - but it was very good - not too sweet or too bitter. I only tried one of the pizzas - the burrata - but that was only because I had like 3 pieces of it. It was so unique and delicious! I had never seen squash on a pizza and was skeptical but it won me over. The burrata on the pizza was also a generous portion. I for sure want this pizza again in the near future! I also really loved the wines I had here - especially the Calcarius Rossopuglia - a greater lighter red for the summer :) Highly recommend trying this out!!",,,

It's not like they were slammed.
What really bugs me, the waitress came by twice to how things are going, but never once said anything about my salad.
The couple in front of me got their order pizza and arugula salad within a reasonable time and we were there pretty much there at the same time and ordered within seconds apart. WTF! I finally got frustrated and ask to be cashed out my $6.61 glass of wine and left her a $2 tip.
I'm a pretty good good tipper, but they/she was not worthy of more.

Seattle, WA","Wonderful casual but nice place with very tasty pizzas, salads and wine!
So far they have not even been open a week but the menu is impressive, everyone is kind and courteous and knowledgeable and the food tastes delicious!
The ambience is the perfect combination between casual and classy. They have a good variety of food without the menu getting too big and cumbersome and their wine selection is varied and pairs perfect with the food! Even pistachio gelato along with a lime sorbet were dessert options!
Critiques/Suggestions:
While I can't criticize at all there are couple things that would be great to see! Perhaps if they do well early on they can add some of these things in the future.
- Lunch grab & go half-pizzas & salad combo
- Stronger local wine selection that pairs well with Italian Cuisine (Brian Carter's Tuttorosso, Five Star Cellars' Sangiovese, Fidelitas' Malbec, Merlot or Cab etc...)
Again, the above are merely some suggestions off the top of my head; none of them are expert business decisions nor are they meant to be any criticism. I'll definitely be back and am looking forward to it already! Living a block away helps too of course!",,,

We really wanted to like this place, but it was absolutely sub par. The server was zombie-esque. Pizza was just OK, barely any flavor. The crust was pretty good, a bit on the chewy side though.
They have 2 beers on tap, both served in wine glasses. So more like 8oz.
The tables were really small and the ambiance was lacking some. Would have liked a little more space in between tables and the lights more on the dimmer side.

Pros:
Great for groups, lots of space and doesn't get too crowded which I like. Our server Andrew was amazing and really went out of his way to give us great service.
Cons:
Apparently they released a new menu the day before we came and boy if I knew I would NOT have come here. Way over priced for the type of food you get, basic bar food at restaurant prices. I was planning on coming and getting food all afternoon for the game but fries alone were almost 10$ after tax. Way way way overpriced for what food you get.

I got to the eatery about 30 minutes after they opened. There were only two others in the restaurant. The bartender chatted up all the patrons and was so nice to interact with. Food came out quickly and the plates were properly warmed. I was impressed that the place had large screen TVs all around each wall of the space which was great. My only gripe was they were mounted close to the ceiling. So Monday Night Football was on the screen in front of me at the bar and I had to strain my neck a little. All in all a decent spot. I really want to rate this higher, but with the prices/portion ratio is a bit off. I will visit again when there are more patrons. Would like to see service with more people in the spot",,,

The dressing the salad dressing that came with the salad brought all the flavors together and really set the salad off. I can go on record and say that this is by far one of the best salads that i have ever had. My friends order a Cajun Chicken sandwich and they said that it was delicious as well.

Appetizer was crab cakes. It was surprisingly a lot. Came with 2 patties the size of a bk whopper.
Entree was was seared ahi tuna. It was decent. Tuna tasted fresh. Visually, it looked pretty light. But it got me pretty full. Maybe because the crab cakes were so huge. Overall, I can't give too many points for vibes, since it was a Sunday night. Flavors for pretty average, but quality of ingredients keep it above average.

This does not make a good sandwich. The pieces kept falling out of the bread. It was a horrible way to eat. The original was the reason I came to the brick repeatedly.

I have now had three bad meals in a row and I am ready to stop trying. That is big bucks I will never get back. How do you screw up a BLT? The bacon was so overcooked that it was more like burnt bacon dust than meat. The ""Philly cheese steak"" was not good and didn't even come with the advertised aioli sauce. My fries sucked and were cold. How on Earth can you make a bad cheese steak? I don't even remember what they screwed up before that but I still remember the dissapointment coupled with a 70 dollar check.

Seattle, WA","True to its name, this place serves up a mean sandwich! There are good restaurants, and then there are restaurants whose food is worthy of random cravings that could happen on any day at any time. Mean sandwich falls squarely in the latter category for me.
The Midnight At the Oasis, the falafel-based sandwich, is one of the best vegan sandwiches I've had anywhere. It simply can't be beet ;)
The chicken cutlet sandwich is SO delicious - it's the one I crave the most when I think of Mean Sandwich.
I've also had one bite of my friend's fish sandwich, which I found to be tasty with inventive flavors.
I'm not a huge fan of the potato skins and ins - I find them to be too crisp and browned for my tastes, but that won't keep me from coming back for the sandwiches (I do wish they offered an additional side dish option or two, though)!",,,

San Francisco, CA","We snuck into Mean Sandwich just before they were going to close for Thanksgiving week. So lucky us. Unluckily they were doing a fried chicken pop-up that same day and it was bonkers inside with lots of people and orders backed up in the kitchen. They did offer to send our food to the brewery next door if we chose to wait there instead but we decided to walk around the neighborhood and come back.
We ordered the steak tartare club and a side of salt and pepper 'skins and ins. It took about 35 minutes for our food. The steak tartare is labor intensive so due to the rush they were batching them as orders came in I think.
Worth it though! What an incredible idea to substitute steak tartare in spicy yuzu mayo for the T in the BLT. And with chewy dense rye bread. The sandwich doesn't look like much but I recommend sharing if you want to include a generous helping of skins as well.
Speaking of which, why has no one else thought about deep frying potato skins? Wonderfully salty, peppery, crispy with yummy soft potato insides. Dangerously addictive and filling. Goes great with beer :-).
Definitely want to come back and try the Midnight at the Oasis next time we're in town.",,,

The burger here is smashed to perfection with very crispy sides and juicy throughout. I'm not a fan of mustard or raw onions on a burger but boy, do they go well with this burger at Mean Sandwich. I'm a fan!
The ""fries"" are not really fries but fried potatoes with skin. I suspect they're baked first and then fried later: Whatever they do with them, they're quite magical :) Crispy skins with the meaty center in that spud.
If you've been to any Fredy's Steakhouse chain location, this is an elevated version of that kind of a burger.

San Diego, CA","Case of ordering wrong? Not sure. We actually made a u-turn to hit up this place to grab some lunch to go for our road trip up north. I always trust a local fav from yelp and the amount of patrons waiting for food further supported that. However, the combination of super long wait, high price and lackluster sandwiches have left me feeling a bit bitter abouts things.
I ordered the Buon Appetito (chicken cutlet sandwich) and the Jersey Sub (Italian sub) which are both $12. I thought it would be a quick process but the shop is small and it was very busy with orders going one at a time. It seemed like there was a combo of 4 or 5 people in the place ahead of me and who knows how many remote ordering. Pro tip (apparently) order ahead for pickup. I think my wait for 2 sandwiches was at least 25 mins.
Out of the 2, the Buon appetito was better, but still mediocre. But the Jersey was just plain bad. Whatever sub roll bread is used tasted like cheap white bread and was probably the primary reason it tasted badly... bread is important. It was just really plain tasting. I hate feeling so strongly on this but for nearly $30 for 2 sandwiches and being in a hurry, this visit was a big mistake and I should have just gotten sandwiches at Safeway for half the price.",,,

Seattle, WA","Spent the afternoon with a friend who suggested we come here for lunch. She told me she had been here before and that I would like it; she was spot on.
Mean Sandwich is a small shop in Ballard that has no frills. Featured in Bon Appetit's 2017 List of America's Best New Restaurants, which I was informed about by my friend, I was intrigued to find a pretty basic menu: 7 sandwiches with 3 daily specials (soup may be one), 1 salad, 3 kinds of fat potato skins: salt & pepper or buffalo sauce or loaded-cheese/chives/bacon bits/more cheese, and yesterday's bun bread pudding.
While my friend and I were staring at the menu trying to decide what to order, a member of BOH came out, started singing loudly along with the 80's song playing and a huge grin. ""What should I get?!"" belted out my friend. ""Buon Appetito,"" he replied. She gushed. He kept singing. She informed me I had to get the skins and share them with her, so we got the salt and pepper.
Buon Appetito is a chicken sandwich with buffalo mayo, provolone, tomato, lettuce, and a pickled pepper relish. It looked huge. It was. My bud ended up taking half the sandwich home for later.
I got the Jersey Sub: capicola, provolone, salami, ham, lettuce, tomato, oregano, oil & vinegar (I asked for no red onion). Amazingly good. Crazy filling. The BREAD, man, the bread. It was like home, only a home I've never had.
Their icon is a pair of lady's lips with red lipstick, and they had free stickers. We each grabbed one. I slapped mine on the back of my day planner which is now in the recycling bin somewhere, and I really, really want to go back and get another sticker. And a sandwich.
You can get delivery. You can get catering. Adult beverages are available. I stuck with a bottle of root beer.

Example of poor ratio: is The Fish is really good when you get the right bite and you get a bit of everything. However the sardines are like 10% of the sandwich. The bread is like 40% the sandwich and at times your just eating bread, which is also really good but I want something in between it. Also the fish is between. The lettuce and the slaw so one bite and half of the fish slides right out the back. Next, thing you know your eating a vegan sandwich of slaw and lettuce.",,,

We came based on the rumors of a delicious sandwich and were not disappointed. The Mean Corned Beef was awesome. A great version of a staple, including mint to add a touch of sweet flavor. The potato sides were also awesome. The part I really want to highlight though is Dan. When I asked what he recommended, he actually asked questions and gave great guidance. He also checked in on us to see if we were enjoying our sandwiches and asked what we thought of our selections. On our way out the door he thanked us for visiting.

Seattle, WA","Very unique signature sandwich. The meat is juicy and delicious and the sandwich is filled with many strong flavored ingredients - and it works. When I saw maple syrup and mint on the menu I thought it was weird, but it really balances the sandwich well. Overall a great sandwich, I'd love to come back to try other sandwiches, the skins and ins, and play corn hole and ping pong in their courtyard.",,,

Seattle, WA","Mean Sandwich is a high quality sandwich place in the south end of Seattle's Ballard. It serves a limited range of well-produced sandwiches.
The restaurant is in an easy location to reach near the bridge. Parking nearby is limited and we were lucky to find a space in relatively short walking distance. We had come for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy.
Inside there is a very limited set of seating. This is a place that probably works best for takeout, since I wouldn't have felt really confident we could sit down, and don't want to let my food get cold. Service was counter-style, and friendly.
The menu is very limited. I knew this going in, but when faced with the actual choices, there are really only two that appeal to me much and really only one I definitely want.
There is a very appealing sounding side (fried potato lumps called skins and ins). This is exactly the sort of thing I typically love, but it was a bit overcooked and oversalted and I liked it but didn't love it, which was the big disappointment of the visit. I had expected this to be the high point.
When the sandwich arrived, it was great quality. I had a Buon Appetito (chicken). The bread is super - which I think is what tends to be most important. Not too sweet or soft. Great bread. The filling was a bit less exciting. It tasted like pretty normal sandwich fare. Not bad in any way, but not amazing. The portions were giant. With the skins, both of us had about twice as much food as we needed for a lunch and should have shared (except that we wanted completely different things).
Overall, this is a pretty good sandwich place. Much better than most of the regular chains or local places. If something from their tiny selection appeals to you, I recommend a visit. I doubt we'll be going very often, because we didn't bond with the choices we made and there isn't much more we want to try.",,,

I think we were oversold on the sandwiches. The hype hurt.
These were solid sandwiches.
The Mean, JCVH and Italian were ok. Nothing stellar. Ironically our veg in the group really loved the falafel sandwich. I agreed and felt a little cheated with my choice of the Italian and the too vinegary sauce and almost Jersey Mike's level of presentation.
I had and have high hopes that some adjustments will help this place live up to the hype like Dingfelders was finally able to do after some adjustments.",,,

Tried the Mai Tai and the Kingston Club (I think that's what it was called) and both were delicious and strong. We tried the artichoke fritters for a light bite and I was not a fan. They were way too doughy for my liking and all together didn't have a ton of flavor.

Seattle, WA","Corvus had been a favorite for drinks, food, and brunch. Reasonably priced, friendly service, and decent acoustics made this a quiet standout. But the last few times have been disappointing, and last night brought back an old gripe about the new waitstaff that has landed in the Puget Sound area: they aren't professional. We arrived in time for happy hour, and ordered food from it. We also ordered two cocktails -- the menu said ""ALL COCKTAILS $2 OFF."" The toddy was ok, a little heavy-handed with the dried spices, and the Last Word was unbalanced, with too much sour competing with the Luxardo and both overwhelming the chartreuse. I could have sent it back, but wasn't in the mood to be ""that guy."" Food was fine as always, especially the fried okra and chickpeas.
When the the bill arrived, it showed the HH for happy hour pricing, but not on the Last Word. I pointed out the wording on the menu, and the waitress told me she only works one night a week and to take it up with the management/owner. No further help from her. Her service was basic, nothing stellar, but that last comment showed how little she cared about customers and the restaurant. Typically I would have sought out management and voiced my concerns, but last night I just wanted to get on with my evening.
It is a small matter, but I hope management clarifies their drink policy or gives staff the ability to make things right.",,,

Redmond, WA","I've only been here for Sunday brunch with friends, so that is what I'm reviewing. I've been here a few times (but only started doing the check-in thing recently), and I've usually ordered the French toast. It's good stuff.
Yesterday, it seems that other customers thought the French toast was such good stuff that it was all gone by the time I arrived, just after 1 pm. The server suggested ""Australian unicorn toast"" as a substitute; it's the special of the day because it was the Australian bartender's birthday. It was a slice of thick toast, sliced diagonally, and served with whipped butter and syrup - pretty much the way French toast would be served, except without the egg batter coating. The portion size was too small, but it was only $3, so I ordered another portion. That was about right, and my tab ended up smaller than usual.
Service has generally been good.
The decor is nice, with a lot of cool art - though strangely (given the place's name) there's only a small picture of a crow on one wall, and a giant picture of an owl on the long wall opposite the bar.
We were seated close to the front door on a cold day, but it didn't feel drafty. I'm not sure how they manage that, but they're doing something right.",,,

I was there to celebrate a friend's birthday and I appreciated how the staff acknowledged the note on the reservation and made special accommodations for us. The birthday boy even ended up receiving a free dessert which was an unexpected but welcome surprise.
The reason why I gave this place only 4 stars was because of my food. My friend got the fettuccine with clams and thoroughly enjoyed his food because it was piping hot. Me on the other hand, ordered the Campanelle and my pasta wasn't warm to the slightest bit. I know my pasta was probably done before my friend's but I wish there was someway to keep dishes warm so we both could have enjoyed our food.

If you're looking at the menu and don't know what to order, get the Campanelle dish with chicken, and unless you love goat cheese, swap it for Parmesan.

Also, these are the most unique pasta noodles you will ever eat.
I've never had a bad experience here. And they've been nothing but accommodating when I've brought my 1 year old. Very happy staff, delicious food worth every $, and out of all the restaurants in the Village, this one is my #1 if I want to sit down with my family.",,,

Seattle, WA","Overpriced, mediocre pasta.
One of my boyfriend's favorite foods of all time is squid ink pasta. So, when we heard this place served it, we decided that we had to come try it for ourselves.
Atmosphere: Probably the best part of our experience. We came in on a Wednesday night. Our area by the windows was peaceful and sparsely populated, making it the perfect location for a nice, pleasant dinner.
Food: I ordered the gnocchi while my boyfriend ordered (you guessed it) the squid ink fettuccine. I was so incredibly let down by the gnocchi. It had no flavor whatsoever; it was like I was eating tasteless carbs. It was my boyfriend's first time ever trying gnocchi, and he was let down by the experience as well.
The squid ink fettuccine, on the other hand, was delicious. However, the quantity was minimal. Despite also ordering a basketful of bread to share between the two of us, my boyfriend was still hungry after eating half of the bread basket plus the fettuccine. At the price point of the meal (discussed shortly), I don't think that should be happening.
Price: It was $16 for each plate of pasta, plus around $3.50 for bread. Combined with tax and tip, we were looking at over $45 for a meal that didn't even make the two of us full. Yikes.
Service: We received our food pretty quickly after ordering, which I appreciated. Our waiter was pleasant, but didn't go out of his way to be extra personable.
Overall: Try another pasta joint for better taste and more bang for your buck. I will likely not be back.",,,

I came in seeking HH while out shopping and mostly just wanted some good wine. The rose I had was indeed delicious even if it was over $12.
Staff was good - attentive.
$3 bread...eh. It was fine. More than enough for people to share.
$10 grilled octopus...I wouldn't recommend. First off, I got severe food poisoning. Second, it was overcooked and super charred making it chewy. The whole plate aside from the little salad was not the most appetizing and super salty. Just not a good overall experience.
I can see this place is trying to be a bit more upscale, and the interior is nice...but I don't think I'd be coming back any time soon.",,,
Piatti,(206) 524-9088,"Erin J.
Seattle, WA","Living in West Seattle, I rarely make it to University Village. I decided to make the trek to the Village over the three day weekend, and had my eye on Piatti for happy hour and to grab dinner to go. Boy, it did NOT disappoint.
I am a sucker for good octopus, which isn't an item you see on a ton of menus around the Pacific Northwest. I was thrilled to see it on their happy hour menu, which is what initially drew me here. It seems they have a rotating preparation of the octopus. When I stopped in, it was wood-fired octopus with chorizo braised white beans, tomato confit, and arugula. At $10 on happy hour, it's a steal. This dish was simply to die for. The octopus was unbelievably tender and paired so well with the smokey chorizo and creamy white beans. It was a struggle to finish it all and could truly serve as a meal in and of itself. However, we did also order one order of their ciabatta bread. The bread was excellent as well: so soft and fluffy seasoned perfectly with salt, garlic, and some other herbs. It was served with olive oil and a nice herbed balsamic vinegar. I'd definitely recommend it to accompany your meal, especially at a mere $3 on happy hour.
To go, I ordered their house made pappardelle and duck bolognese. This, too, was heavenly. I've had other house made pasta that was too thin and mushy. I appreciated this fresh pasta really maintained its integrity. It was still nice and elastic even after reheating at home. And the bolognese itself was perfection. Though prepared classically with carrot, celery, and Italian spices, it was really a memorable dish. The duck was a refreshing change from the typically heavy and often flavorless beef you get in so many bolognese dishes.
The restaurant itself is massive. We were promptly seated and the service was friendly. The drinks are a bit on the high side, even on happy hour, but the phenomenal happy hour and killer dinners more than made up for it.
Overall, I think Piatti is a must-stop when you're in the U-Village area.",,,

The only negative I would have to say is that prices are a little north of what we're used to paying. Ex: lunch was a little more than I'd normally pay at another restaurant. The lunch portions were also on the smaller side. But, keep in mind you are in U-Village at a fairly nice restaurant.",,,

The meat and cheese plate? Needs help. It wasn't even about the meat and cheese that comes with the plate, those were great! The brie and fig jam along with grilled bread was fantastic too.
But the sides they added with it was just odd to me. It really brought the experience down. Instead of some nuts, or pickles or crackers... they give you beets??
Beets!?
No. I do not like knowing what the earth tastes like. Thank you.
Also, the pickled veggies I was excited about was actually carrots (only one slice) celery (fine I'll eat it) but then get this... onions. Pickled onions. Not even the purple kind you may find on a fancy taco somewhere. Why would anyone want to eat pickled onions like that?
I may be in the minority here with that one. But I haven't seen it before so it threw me off.
The place itself was awesome. Staff professional and classy. Place was empty when we got there but jam packed by the time we were done. There is definitely a lunch rush here.

She wasn't what I would deem friendly in any sense of the word, but took my drink order and came back with in shortly.
My friend arrived about 15 minutes later and we placed our dinner order. Again, the server was less than warm and friendly. We ordered the margherita pizza, arancini, and salad with prawns. The food was very good.

There's a line out the door on busy nights, but even then, I get in & get out pretty quick. Their pies are plentiful. I never feel like Im getting skimped & the pricing is nice. You can easily feed 2 people for $10. If you're willing to wait, I highly recommend the garlic bread. Delicious. Rocco's responded quickly to the changes of COVID-19 & I respect them for that.",,,

My daughter had the cheesiest pizza and loved it and I'm a simple bell peppers and onion person with mushrooms depending on my mood. This is such a great place for the yummiest pizza. Passed though many places since then but haven't come across any pizzerias like this. We had a door delivery so I have absolutely no idea about the ambience and parking and other peripherals . Food wise amazing and woah love it ..",,,

Delicious pizza with a healthy amount of cheese and toppings. I can't wait to dine-in soon. I had problems with the delivery service Caviar and let Rocco's know via email. The owner personally called. You can't get better service than that. Great job Jesus and team! This place has a new fan.",,,
Rocco鈥檚,(206) 448-2625,"Nate H.
Seattle, WA","This is the best pizza I've had yet in Seattle, and it's not even close.
I can't say that I was disappointed by the Seattle pizza scene, because I didn't expect much. Every other pizza that has been recommended to me tasted like mall / sewer pizza (you know, the kind that crawled out of the grate).
Anyways, a trusted colleague recommended Rocco's to me, and so I jaunted down to this fine establishment after a long day at work. My lady friend was running late, so I ordered a beer from my main man, Dave. Dave was truly an outstanding staff member. An incredibly charismatic person, who was brutally honest about the menu, and knew it like the back of his hand. After asking him for his recommendations, he actually told me what NOT to pick, which was an interesting way to go about it.
After sipping on our beers and watching some enormous slices slide on out of their ovens, I had refilled my beer glass off of my saliva alone. It was time for our salad. This was a perfect way to tide us over until the pizza. This huge plate of greens, cheese, and other things that weren't cheese, was just enough to make sure that we didn't leave the place feeling disgusting from the amount of pizza that we ate.
Finally, the grand finale. Stacey and Tina's Night Out. The name of this pizza itself really caught our eye, it just seemed like the most fun pizza on the menu, like we really wanted to hang out with these two. The toppings on this pizza are incredible. Banana peppers add that sweet spiciness that works so well with the meat. The crust here is what really makes the pizza though. They have figured out the perfect consistency matched up with the perfect level of crisp. Add some extra spices to the crust, and you've got yourself the ideal West Coast Pie.",,,
Rocco鈥檚,(206) 448-2625,"Caroline T.
Seattle, WA","Coming from the East coast, I have some pretty high expectations about pizza quality, I admit it. But Rocco's is one of the few spots in Seattle that's come close, taste wise, to some of the pies I'd find back home.
I've held off on trying Rocco's because, sadly, it's another place that charges way too much for pizza (ex: cheese pizza is $18 for half/4 slices, or $29 for a whole pie. Not including tax and tip). Today I finally opted to try it, thanks to a discount with a food delivery service. I went with their 'Build Your Own - 1 topping' half pie, typically $21, but ended up paying $8.
The slices are huge, and reminiscent of what you'd get in New York. The slices aren't too thin, so you can't easily fold the slice, but they're a good balance of soft and crispy. It didn't taste like I was eating just dough, and the slices weren't burnt on the bottom or on the crust. My slices weren't dripping in oil, so no napkins were harmed with this meal.
Honestly, I really liked their pizza. Still not a fan of their prices, but I'd certainly come back and try a few slices or get a pie whenever any of the delivery apps have deals.
Tips:
-They offer some home cocktail kits through the food delivery apps
-Half pie = 4 large slices in a regular pizza box (no bonus sliver slice like you'd find in California)
-Street parking is available, however there are car prowlers in the area so be mindful
-Be careful of the bicycle lane in front of the building",,,

Seattle, WA","I don't write reviews often, however after my experience today, I felt like it was something that must be shared. I've eaten at Rocco's a total of four times and each time the pizza has been delicious: some favs of mine are definitely the ""Fun-guy"" and White Sausage. However, the reason I felt compelled to write this review is because of the service my friends and I have experienced at each of our visits. They always give the table a bottle of cucumber water and regular water, but they rarely ever come by to replace these bottles with new ones. Today, our pizza arrived after around 30 mins (understandable since we ordered a full pie) and as the waiter was walking away I asked him if we could get more regular water for the table. His response was very sarcastic and condescending and it took me, my partner, and my friend completely off guard: ""You mean the bottle that I have in my hand right now that I'm currently going to replenish?"" Surely he did not have to respond in such an uncalled for way and it really made our table feel uncomfortable. This really sucks, because the pizza was great as always. We were very conflicted throughout our meal because this was the fourth time we have experienced poor service with our waiters at Rocco's, and even my friend who came with some other friends has had poor service experiences as well.
TLDR: Pizza's great, but the service is not. Bring your own water bottle if you want to stay hydrated, but don't ask for refills. 鈥?

Just the smell of fresh pizza makes me smile :) And it's a pleasure to know the passion, dedication and speed (even if you have to wait because of the number of orders and one oven) of making everything from scratch. The way the pizza makers manage the dough was impressive.
The menu is quite selective. Everything is so tasty!!! And huge. So if you are having a vegeterian pizza, you might not be able to ask for a slide. And getting the hole pizza for one person was a whole day adventure for me! We even order the cheese bread. My God, not the best idea but I must say that if you are tasting the menu, you ""must"" have them! Hahaha By the way, I loved their cucumber water and the friendly staff."

Los Angeles, CA","Slowly becoming a stop every time I visit back home.
Celebrated the new year by taking my parents up to Roccos during a day in the city, since I was having Funguy cravings.
Came thru Roccos 3ish years ago for the first time, and you wouldnt really think pizza like this existed in Seattle, but they bring their pizza game up a notch above all the rest. It's a bit pricey, but its well worth the price.
This last stop we grabbed half Fun Guy and Half of our own with Pepperoni, sausage, and Jalapenos. I'm gonna say this if you're down with truffle and mushrooms then Fun Guy will be your go to, but if you want to turn it up a notch and want a protein I usually add sausage to the mix, and it becomes its own complete pizza. They're never shy with the toppings, so if you get pepperoni expect more than just a couple on each slice.
What they do with the crust here is pretty special. You know its a good pizza when you eat the whole thing, crust included, and they always hit that perfect spot of a nice soft but crunchy crust.
If you want to taste some of the best a whole large pie is gonna run you about $40, but its a huge pizza. Im guessing 18-20in, so come hungry, but if you dont want a whole pie they have a selection of slices that you can grab up front. You can either eat those in or get them to go. Pair these up with some solid cocktails and you've found yourself a winner in all of Seattle.
Eat here!",,,

The place is small and we were told it would be a 30 minute wait at 9pm on a Friday. I was rather surprised by that, but it's really not a very big place.
We waited 5 minutes and two spots at the bar opened. The bar is nice and betterr than the booths.
Service is not bad, but seemed a bit robotic and not entirely genuine.

We ordered one whole Bahn Mi Pork pizza, half Bahn Mi Portobello pizza (yes they have a vegetarian version!!!), half Veggie Box pizza, and one whole BBQ Pork pizza.
The Banh Mi pizza was still great, but didn't taste as flavorful as usual. Its vegetarian version (with portobello mushroom) tasted almost no difference from the original. I loved it!!! The BBQ Pork was good as always but a bit too cheesy for me, since I'm never a big fan of cheese. I didn't try the Veggie Box but heard that it was okay, not impressive.

The first night I had a slice that the Chef's had made up - it was vegetarian. The slices are huge and more than enough. The second night I got the BBQ chicken pizza - the bacon and ranch were too sweet for my taste, but the crust was phenomenal.

Mushroom pizza had a lot of mushrooms, so it was very flavorful. The combo pizza pretty much reminded me of costco pizza. So maybe their toppings are just from costco....
Only thing going is that it was open late and the slices are big. There was a lot left to be desired here.
It was interesting that you need to be seated here for a slice of pizza. I was expecting more of a fast pace for a slice of pie.",,,

Rocco's came through with flying colors. The service was good despite the fact that they were quite busy. I went with a good vegetable pizza, the portions are quite generous, plenty of toppings to satisfy your cravings and it is done just right.
All this washed down with a good IPA Beer and I was refueled and ready for the trek back to my conference.

I grabbed a seat at the bar, and the gentleman sitting beside me immediately asked if I had been there before. I said no, and he said well you are in for some of the best pizza in Seattle. Of course, I was now even more excited.
I ordered a beer while I took a look at the pizza menu. Luckily they have slices here, so I was able to order two that I wanted to try. The first was a veggie slice, topped with all things amazing goodness. Including two of my favorites, artichoke hearts and goat cheese. It was so delicious I didn't even notice there wasn't any meat on it. Once I saw the size of the slices, I realized I should probably have just gotten one. So I took my second slice, a pulled pork and bacon phenomenon, to go. I enjoyed it later for dinner. Actually I only enjoyed half of it, as I was still pretty full from the first piece! It was smothered in barbecue sauce, amazingly prepared pork, and generous amounts of bacon and cheese.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention how fantastic the crust was at Rocco's. I can see why the dude next to me like that so much. It was crusty, roasty, and perfectly flavored. It made me miss the crust at Goat Mountain Pizza, which used to be my go-to pizza spot in Bellingham.
The service was so friendly and helpful. The bartender will apparently make you a concoction based on your mood and your choice in liquor. While I was tempted, it was more of a beer type of afternoon since I had a lot of things to do. However, I am definitely going to return and have one of his signature cocktails in the future!",,,

I highly recommend this pizza place for both great customer service and food quality! My husband and I along with two other friends went into this pizza parlor hoping to just satisfy our pizza craving. Boy was it the right decision, we found that this place had several good reviews on yelp and said what the heck let's just try it.
Well when we got there it was a 30 minute wait for a table of 4. Okay, fine, whatever put us on the waiting list. We were finally called up by the awesome security guy and went in to try the food.
We were sat on a nice round table towards the end of the bar/pizza parlor. We ordered drinks and commented to the waiter that the boys were starving. We were about to order two pizzas when he said ""I've had several previous customers who are only able to finish one pizza, do you want to try that and order more if you're still hungry?"" Everyone said sure fine let's do that.
So we ordered a nice appetizer of mozzarella cheese sticks with alcohol beverages. Hmm were those cheese sticks delicious! Highly recommend the pizza, the mozzarella cheese sticks, and the some beverages to go with it.

We ordered a pizza with half fun-guy and half lasagna. I loved the fun guy and the truffle flavors but I think I preferred the lasagna one more because it has meat (I'm a carnivore, what can I say? Sorry not sorry).
It does seem a little pricey for pizza but it is really good and the portions are huge! Each of my friends and I only ate two slices each before we called it and we can eat a lot.

I came here for before going to a show at the Crocodile one night. Dave was our friendly and charismatic waiter. My wife ordered the best cocktail ever - called something like I'm In Love With An Actual Legend. It was delicious, but most importantly it came with the words tiniest clothes pin.
My favorite pizza we ordered was the Jalapano Popper style one. I didn't know that this was a thing somebody could do with a pizza. And good lord I'm glad they did! Also the goat cheese and beets appetizer was amazing, but the cheesy bread is worth ordering if you're the less adventurous type.

A lot of food trucks are not very good, but this is the kind of food truck that made them a fad in the first place. I've paid twice as much to eat pasta that wasn't half as good, so this is the real deal to me.
I'm looking forward to more from them. I'm especially looking forward to seeing what this truck does when they have fresh chanterelles. I saw a chanterelle sticker on the window and asked about it and they said they serve them when the chef can find fresh ones. When everything is so well done, that gets really exciting for me.
The only issue I have with this place is that their food is so good it would pair well with good wine and they don't sell wine. Usually when the food is so good I'm nearly deliriously happy from eating it I have wine with it.

Another experimentation with pork belly has always lead to successful cuisine combinations and carbonara is once again justified for all the pasta lovers. Each noodle size smaller than adult teeth to insure a seamless and fluid bite down. With it's cheesy mixtures to tone down the viscosity and your bite powers, your observation of a warm cooked meal is a slow motion endeavor that gives the illusion of a slurpy session, but in reality a speedy booking to the hunger rooms to insure full capacity is attained in less than the total time taken to prepare and cook the meal.

If you are in a sharing mood, the gnocchi with Gorgonzola is also a good way to start a meal here:) the buffalina is prob my favorite. You can really taste the fresh tomato sauce and the creamy buffalo cheese. If ordering two pizzas, this is always one of them. Also a nice wine selection, Chianti is my go to. The Nutella calzone is a great way to end a meal if you've saved room. I was skeptical ordering but it is not overly sweet, well balanced amount of Nutella with dough and some fresh fruit. In the summer they have an outdoor deck in the back.",,,

Seattle, WA","The pizza here is Neapolitan style, similar to Tutta Bella or Via Trublinali. I went here on an afternoon for the happy hour, but after reading the reviews about how small the hh pizza was and finding that it was only 6$ off the list price, it would make it $11 for a 9"" pizza, wow.
The full price pizza I got was Prosciutto which cost $17, it was barely 12"" maybe 11. Incredibly bland with little to no cheese and a very slim layer of 5 small pieces of prosciutto. I asked for extra sauce on the pizza, but it still came a bit dry so I asked for some on the side.
They charged me $1 for the sauce and $17 for a tiny mediocre pizza. I was amazed that they are in business. total or $24 for lunch and I was still hungry afterwards....:(
Great location with nice western sun and outside seating front and back. It's really too bad they are not making a better effort on the food.",,,

Seattle, WA","Very cute date spot in the heart of Greenwood. They make everything right in front of you in the brick oven, which is very cool. Their wood fired pizza is really delicious & I loved the flavor on the crust. I ordered the Cipollina & my boyfriend ordered the spaghetti alle vongole. We watched them cook both our orders, they cook the clams in the wood oven & pour the clam juice right onto the pasta so it gets a really great flavor. The pizza was very tasty, I added mushrooms for a little extra flavor. My only complaint was that it was unclear that the pizza did not come with red sauce, it only had olive oil as the sauce. It still tasted great, it just wasn't what I expected. We also ordered a side of bread on the side for the pasta, so soak up the leftover clam sauce because it was so yummy. I also had a glass of wine that was just ok. Overall, I'd go back Cornuto for a nice date night. I'm not sure how it vibes with the rest of the spots in the neighborhood, which are more family oriented, this place is a bit more upscale.",,,

I love to come here late in the evenings because there is a bartender who makes a killer Amaretto Sour. I have also tried a few of their drink specials, and they never fail to be delicious.

The pizza is just the way I like it, with a thin crust, but not so paper thin that it's a big cracker. Cocktails were spot on and the tiramisu was addictive. I got home and wished I had gotten some to go... still thinking about it weeks later.
But this review is more about the service, which I can confidently say was perfect. Josephine (blonde hair, early 20s), was one-hundred-percent accurate in anticipating our needs and offered us what we needed before we even knew we needed it. She was congenial and attentive without being over-the-top. As a veteran server, I realize how difficult this can be and her nuanced attentiveness deserves a tip-of-the-hat. In fact, both of the ladies on the floor that night were working in tandem, the energy was just right, and I was truly impressed. It's refreshing to see a newer spot have good food and amazing service. Looking forward to coming back for more of that killer tiramisu and ladies, keep crushing it. You're appreciated!!!",,,

Customer service is always quick and friendly.
I only wish that the restaurant/cafe portion was just a bit bigger, as half of the space is allocated to groceries. Some context on this: The neighborhood would not let any businesses operate a full fledged restaurant/cafe here, so hence the poor use of space. On the upside, it's fun to peruse the shelves while you wait for your order. Makes you feel like you're overseas, looking at specialty groceries, where the price is not a concern because you don't feel like doing the exchange rate conversion in your head.

Los Angeles, CA","Found Little Lago to stop in on a daylight-savings Sunday for brunch. I'm gonna be upfront and say I'm going to digress rn from a review of the restaurant because I've always been confused with the necessity of daylight-savings. I mean, it seems like more trouble than it's worth and we, as human beings with time-keeping devices like watches, clocks, and sundials, should be able to just deal with the sun setting later without having to observe this semi-annual ruse to fool ourselves. The worse part of daylight-savings is ""losing"" an hour each Spring. What the heck am I saving, exactly?*
Well, back to the review.
A combination of a neighborhood bakery, deli, and small market, Little Largo reminds me of Clementines in Century City, Los Angeles (my old neighborhood in LA), except with fewer selections of deli items. Pricing is definitely on the higher side, but that probably has to do with the economics of being in that particular neighborhood? Parking was available directly in front, with a loading zone that could be used on Sunday (check the parking rules for Seattle for yourself, please).
I had their arugula salad with a 1/4 pound each of their chicken/apple salad and roasted cauliflower deli offerings. Quite delicious, although I would have preferred a little less dressing in the arugula salad. Maybe I should have just asked for said selections to be served on a bed of plain arugula because there definitely was enough flavor to carry the plate.
My son and his girlfriend both ordered sandwiches, and shared a lavender cookie between them while we were waiting for our food (they're in college, so too old for me to scold them about sweets before a meal). I could only watch on as they made short work of it because my cheat day was the day before (FYI, cheat day was glorious)--okay, I did snag the tiniest piece of crumb to, yes, confirm that the cookie tasted as good as it looked.
We were there for about an hour, and as late as 2:00pm there was still a healthy amount of traffic coming into the establishment. Whether that was due to the effects of daylight-savings or otherwise, it's hard to tell.
Given its proximity to UW and my preference to frequent anywhere with easy parking I am pretty positive we'll be back.
*Note: I am all for observing daylight-savings in the fall because we can all use at least one ""do-over"" hour every year.",,,

But unfortunately I cant shake the consistently negative counter service I have received. Every interaction (over a dozen times this past year) I have had seems to be an annoyance for the person working.

Bothell, WA","Dined here recently with a work group. We figured Italian would appeal to most tastes.
My critique is only on my food, since our group was large and I don't want to speak for anyone else there.
Overall rating? 2 stars. It was ok, but nothing to knock my socks off. On the level of a local version of Olive Garden perhaps?
Good menu selection and interesting sounding items. Service was very good considering our group size. Portions ok as was the temperature and time from order to service.
I ordered a luncheon special that had a cream sauce, sausage, mushrooms and I believe spinach. The ingredients sounded delicious. It arrived and was tasty. The pasta component was a bit too soft for me. I like it a bit more al dente.
Given our group, we all knew the 20% surcharge rule. I'm o.k. with that, and know going in. My biggest beef is that the 20% on my bill was computed on the total bill WITH sales tax.
If I'm not mistaken, I thought tips start with the food subtotal, not the total WITH sales tax. So, the tip base starts out larger when tax is included. Whether intentional or not, in my book it's not very transparent. You are automatically adding another 10% to the tipping base. Adds up over time.
Anyway, this is not one of my go-to places, having been here only once or twice before over the years. No big loss in my big dining picture. I have other favorites.",,,

The d茅cor is classic upscale Italian restaurant chic. The wait staff is wonderful, attentive, professional and informed and then of course, there's the food. It's always delicious.
Last Sunday mom and I went to Grazie's.
We ordered Bruschetta with 3 spreads; olive tapenade, chopped tomatoes and a truly delicious (was it freshly made?) ricotta. We each had salad. Me, a small house salad, mom. a small pear gorgonzola salad. I ordered a pasta dish with chicken, capers. white wine and pine nuts, she ordered shrimp and crab cannelloni. We shared a fruit tart for dessert.
What a delicious dinner. We both agreed that the Bruschetta and a side salad would make a very good light lunch.

They also have a parking lot which makes going here convenient. There are plenty of spaces and even though it had a ton of cars in it, you would not have trouble finding a space.
As for the dining room which we did not eat in, it looked decently filled with people. The event room is off to the back corner and is nicely arranged with multiple tables, some windows for lighting, doors that cancel out the noise etc. Would I hold my event here, probably not because it is not really my style but would I recommend it to anyone looking to have a small to mid size family dinner, sure.
We had a set menu this night so the following was chosen by one of colleagues coordinating the event I imagine. I ended up trying a bite of the Dungeness Crab and Artichoke Dip, which was pretty good. I ate it without the crackers and was still a fan. The Crab and Shrimp Cannelloni looked and smelled like some really good fresh pasta and crab. For my dish, I had the Chicken Marsala. It was good but I never order that dish anywhere else so I am not really sure where it falls on the scale. I would recommend it though if you are trying to follow a certain diet routine or want a good meal of protein. The risotto which I only had one bite of was amazing.

I've been to the Southcenter location previously and really enjoyed the food (especially since they offered gluten free pasta :) ) and really appreciated their customer service. I didn't realize there was a location in Bothell until I found it via Yelp. Everyone raved about the customer service at this establishment, so we decided to celebrate there.
Upon arrival, no one was at the hostess desk but we saw workers around in the dining room and bar. After several minutes, a salt and peppered hair gentlemen in a black server uniform greeted me with ""Yes?"" I told him that we needed a table for four and requested a more secluded table. My though process for this request being: 1) the twins could be loud and I didn't want them to disturb others, and 2) the twins were born three months premature, have weak immune systems and respiratory issues so it was an attempt for me to TRY to protect them from any potential cold germs floating around. The gentlemen simply looked at me when I asked him for a more secluded table and walked away. No reply... nothing... I'm assuming when he walked away, that was our que to follow him... As we entered the dining room, he immediately walked to the first booth in the center of the dining room. I though maybe he didn't hear me when I requested a more private table, so I asked if we could sit in one of the corner booths. He gave me a look and stated that these were the booths that were being seated at the moment.
As we started unpacking our own travel high chairs, he came and tried to take our drink order. I found it really irritating as we hadn't even sat down, he saw that we were struggling to get the twins settled, and yet it seemed like he was rushing us in choosing that moment to take our drink order. After that, I'm not sure what happened, but I believe we were passed off to another server. The poor lady was also supporting the bar and coming to try to serve us as well. She wasn't the friendliest but she was sufficient. At the end, she even gave us a small smile. The best part of this experience was a man that looked like he was the manager. He helped me select a birthday dessert for our nanny and arranged for it to be delivered to us after our meal.
At 3pm, I no longer saw the original gentleman. Perhaps he was irritated with us because we arrived at 2pm and he got off at 3pm? Or maybe his lunch break was at 3pm, he was HANGRY and taking it out on us? LOL! I am not sure, but I more than likely will not be visiting this location again. It is difficult enough to pack the twins and all their ""luggage"" for an outing... but when we actually do make it out, I don't need an unfriendly face and attitude.",,,

We ordered arugula and pepperoni pizza and unfortunately what we got was a dried leather thin plates for the arugula with barely any topping on it and my daughters pepperoni was all grease. I should have checked because the boxes were so light, but it was drop at the door and drive away style delivery. Needless to say so much for pizza night. I was really disappointed. Especially for $50. I called the restaurant and they said they can't help call uber eats. Well they don't have a phone now and email stated they can't help either. Regardless the pizza was not worth its name.",,,

It looked busy, but that just might have been our area. Our waiter was really nice and went through the specials for the night. We ordered Calamari Fritti and Tortellini Fritti to start. SO Yummy! They were cooked perfectly and came out hot! Loved the dipping sauces they came with too. Then we got the Spaghettini Bolognese, Lasagna, and one of the Specials which was Salmon with a fruit salsa and risotto. The food came out right after we finished the appetizers. Nice portions, hot plates. The lasagna was really good, especially the pesto sauce. I think the Spaghettini and Salmon could of had more flavor to it.",,,

1: The food is absolutely fabulous. We have been there a number of times and strangely enough I've never ordered off of the menu because the fresh sheet always has three or four options and one of them always suits my taste. Absolutely fabulous. Never left this place thinking anything less
2: Don't like what's on the menu? That's absolutely fine because chef will make you what you want. On a number of occasions I've gone in there just thinking about veal Parmesan and absolutely done no question. Just ask what you want and they'll make it for you
3: their staff is indescribable. I do not know where they find these people and can't figure out why other restaurants can't find people like this. They don't wait on you, they cater to you. We were just there this evening and cared for by Jenna. It was like we were part of her family. All of the waitstaff is like this.
After probably 20 visits over the last 2 1/2 years we have never left this establishment doing anything but talking about how fabulous the food and the staff are.

Everett, WA","I just tried this place for the first time recently and my initial impression is that it's just a step up from Olive Garden. The step up coming from the nice live smooth jazz band playing on Saturdays and a pretty decent service. Otherwise, the menu and food quality is somewhat disappointing.
First, the bread served appears to be store bought and lacks flavor. There is nothing in it that draws me to take another piece. The soup selections are only two different types of bisques. I had the garlic soup which was tasty, but I would have preferred a more authentic Italian option. I am pretty big on soups after all. Lastly, I had the tagliatelle primavera for the main course which is a wood oven grilled vegetable garlic pasta. The dish was a bit overcooked and the char flavor was overpowering. This made it difficult to eat.
Overall, I gave the place a mixed rating. I may return to try other dishes, but this won't be my go to place.",,,

This review is written based on the fact that we ordered as an Uber Eats customer. We got the Fettuccine Con Salmon, the Hummus Plate, and Fettuccine Carbonara!
All of the foot completely hot and the presentation was easy to put onto dinner plates. Portions are massive here so plan to split if you're not hungry. The Fettuccine Carbonara is delicious if you add peas to it. It adds an earthy note and really was impressed with the quality of the food.

Service was quick, I was cranky-hungry. We probably waited for 6-8 minutes.
The pizza was good, but it was extremely salty in my standards. Other things to note is that I couldn't sleep well. I had it at 7/8pm at night for dinner. I am giving this place 2 stars because of how quick it was and the server was nice to offer water while we waited in store.
I never felt so jittery going to sleep after eating pizza that I baked from the grocery store, even Pagliacci's, or Ian's on the Hill. This one definitely affected my sleep and it was a lot breadier than the other slice pizzas I've had at Pagliacci's. My friend also didn't feel too great in the morning. I don't know what is in the pizza but I definitely did not feel good after eating it. Not sure I'll be back but to each their own!

My review stems after picking up a delivery for Uber Eats for them. As I sat and waited for what she said would be a couple minutes (really 15+min) I sat and observed some things that really struck me.
I was shocked to see MULTIPLE people in the kitchen eating their own food with their bare hands, LICKING their fingers and going right back to preparing people's food. I could have taken a video it happened so many times. I would imagine it's family owned because the the front counter worker and an older gentleman were in some type of dispute (not English) the entire time I was there as well. I know guests in the restaurant could hear and were looking at them as well. It was awkward.
People should trust that their food is being prepared in a sanitary environment. I will never go back because of all of the finger lickin in the kitchen. And hope this review brings awareness to this issue.",,,

Seattle, WA","I have been ordering from this place for a year and a half, and I constantly ask myself why. It's the closest pizza place to me that delivers and it has good pizza--when they make it with all the ingredients I paid for, which is maybe 25% of the time. I order from this place almost weekly, and it is astounding, actually hilarious, how often they forget to put basil or some other ingredient on my pizza. (This is something I always pay extra for. Sometimes I have the heart to send it back, sometimes I don't.) It feels especially awful sending it back tonight when I already waited an hour and a half to receive it. I ordered this pizza on Grubhub so I wouldn't have to talk to anybody, but I had to call twice: once to check to see if my pizza is still coming, another time to send it back because it was a) as cold as a frozen pizza and b) does not have the elementary, advertised ingredients. I even put a note on the Grubhub order: ""Please knock and leave the pizza on the front porch."" Of course, the delivery guy is right there with it.

My girlfriend had suggested we try it and I obliged since I had already eaten at Talaricos and figured I could just get a salad. Our first experience here was great, the server was very accommodating, super nice and our food came out quickly. I got the house salad and a side of chicken breast, chicken was a little burnt but fine. House salad was fresh. No complaints. Gf got the pasta with blush sauce and loved it, she said it was creamy and rich. She echoed my sentiments about the house salad but said her olives (I didn't get any) tasted bad. She had nothing to say about the garlic bread.
On our second visit here with some friends, my gf got the same thing. She said it was fine. I ordered a pizza with our friends and we had asked about adding chicken to it, our server immediately said, ""we don't add chicken to our pizzas"" and yet you can order a piece of chicken as a side. She didn't mention it to us, just said no. Then she asked us about splitting the bill and told us they don't split pizzas in half (price). We had just inquired because we wanted to know but we were met with some rudeness. It was a very interesting experience overall. The pizza was okay, felt burnt on top. I was super hungry so I ate it but I also knew my stomach was going to hurt. The menu hadn't adequately advertised how much cheese was on it, just mentioned the types.

I will say my initial experience is what really surprised me - fast service and delicious, affordable food! Second experience very meh but still good. It appears to be locally owned, with a lax staff. Which is nice. My parties had a few awkward moments with the staff - perhaps because we are still new to the area / are especially new to this restaurant. I personally have ordered the same pasta both experiences, blush sauce pasta with a salad and bread. Totally worth the price. That being said second time around I thought, maybe it's just good cause I don't eat pasta at all - and while I am definitely going to be back (bc yum!) I've made easily comparable meals with minimal effort. Don't mean it isn't good, just means I'll pick this place over my own work if 1) I don't wanna cook 2) I wanna go out.

Last night was the last straw; once again, they didn't care that the order had been screwed up and I didn't have enough time to have the pizza remade. Just shrugged and took my card.
My favorite moment remains the time a couple of months ago when I called on the phone to order, got put on hold for 15 minutes, got tired of being on hold and walked down to order with my phone still with me, ordered at the counter, and waited and got my pizza, still able to see the light blinking on the phone to show I was on hold.

Totem Lake, Kirkland, WA","So, we came in for a triple couples date with my sisters and their boyfriend/husband. I was thinking it would be a nice date.
Turns out that if you get Prince Charming as a server, he is a gem. He made me want to come back again just because he has a great personality. He does give me less of a stiff professional and more of a ""welcome to the family table"" that I expect from all the ads for Olive Garden I've seen. There was also a moment that a man in the window behind me at our table joked that whomever went through the door should serenade him. It made my whole table happy and enjoying the night in full.
As per food, it was excellent and I would come back to have more.",,,

Seattle, WA","TLDR: salty and food coma-inducing but worth it.
Private parking lot but with an awkward entrance along a busy local road. Might be difficult to turn into during peak hours.
Atmosphere: Somewhat dimly lit at night so all you food paparazzi can expect a warm yellow glow to your food pictures unless you use flash, which I don't recommend because it will give your food that awful teenage forehead shine in photos. If you want to take photos of OG food, do it under natural light at a window seat.
Service: wait to be seated, order at the table, you will be watered, check brought to you, leftovers boxed for you (don't forget to bag those uneaten breadsticks!).
Bread Sticks: I've always been a fan of their notoriously good comp bread sticks but man are those main dishes salty. If you aren't reaching for your drink during your meal, then you will definitely be reaching for one later when your veins start shriveling.
Soup or Salad is complimentary when you get a main entree. I've always been a fan of their soups more than their salads. If I'm going to dine here, I'm going to DINE here. None of this silly rabbit food salad that I could make at home for a couple bucks. Go big or go home I'd say. That, and eat your money's worth haha.
Zuppa Toscana: my new favorite soup. Despite the menu listing ""spicy"" Italian Sausage, it's not spicy at all. If you are a seasoned reader of my reviews, you know that I'm ""I sweat when I eat Taco Bell Mild sauce"" spice intolerant. So if I say I can handle this dish, then you sure as hell can too.
Chicken Giardino: pretty good and not as overpowering flavor wise compared to the other dishes. I like this one because it seems to have a somewhat even balance of pasta, chicken, and veggies. The sauce is pretty good too and isn't too ""accidentally whip spaghetti sauce in your face"" thick.
Primavera Zoodles: yummmm. I feel super healthy eating this. But the sauce can be a little much. I feel like I wouldn't be reaching for so much water if maybe they only used 3/4 the amount of sauce normally used. I normally don't pass out from a carb coma eating this so it's pretty safe to say you can plan on doing things after your meal, that is if you didn't take that additional helping of those damn good bread sticks.",,,

Seattle, WA","Came here for lunch on MLK day. The restaurant was full for a mid day, but some I am sure some people like me had Monday off. I will say the restaurant was run by mostly young (high school/early college) employees. Service was good, they were attentive to customers.
My big complaint was that the wine glasses that were on the clean table were clearly dirty and even so with the empty clean table next to us had the same thing.
As for food I ordered the seafood fettuccini which was okay, I didnt think the sauce was as thick and flavorful as I was hoping for but the mojito I ordered was great. I also liked the $5 lunch to take home. Overall I think it's a little pricy for the quality of entree but I love the bread and zuppa Toscana soup.",,,

Food is generally ok but nothing that I would bring family out of town to try. The servers are hit or miss--sometimes you get an attentive one, other times you get stuck with a server that prioritizes the larger tables (20% of 6 is better than 20% of 2). I think the biggest let down to this location is the staff at the front of the restaurant. They are typically young, rude, impolite and do not say a word to you on the way out.

I always get the chicken Parmesan and am glad the portions are huge because the price seems to always go up. This time the chicken was over salted so I was constantly downing water. My daughter had the spaghetti and meatballs which didn't look very appetizing but she enjoyed it, and my wife liked her eggplant Parmesan. Appreciated the endless salad and breadsticks too. Service was friendly to start, but then she disappeared after bringing our entrees and we didn't see her for over 30 minutes, even after asking another waiter and pressing that button on the table tablets. Seemed like the staff was just standing around various corners of the restaurant rather than helping out, which was irritating. But if you want to get your Olive Garden fix, here you go.",,,

-breadsticks as everybody knows are great here and are always the same. They can't mess this one up.
-The chicken Parmesan was over cooked garbage. inedible and horrible.
-The deep fried ravioli tasted like it had been fried three times over. More fried than anything else. Also inedible.
-The spaghetti was OK but it would be better fresh. I could make better spaghetti at home.

Pros: never had to wait too long, staff have always been nice to me (unlike others reviews, I seem to be lucky!), if there have been issues, staff have resolved them for me, and politely!
Cons: Food is lukewarm for some bizarre reason. Menu is expensive for a chain - that's not this locations fault though, as that is set at corporate level! I think because salad/breadsticks are part of the meal, they up the prices to cover this ""complimentary"" service.
Overall, this location has good amount of parking, sometimes the outside can be dirty, which isn't ideal when entering a restaurant. Food doesn't look appetizing, but taste isn't the worst.

My waitress was fine if hurried, but my requests misfired. My martini with no vermouth was pretty watery and did have vermouth. I drank it as she seemed stressed. I ordered the eggplant parmigiana with angel hair rather than spaghetti and asked for very little salad. I think she tried to make a small salad but it was still too much. As for my entree: spaghetti all the way.
Beyond that, I should also remember that good Italian food is not likely there. Greasy and bland at the same time. I need some sort of a taser that stops me when about once a year I think to try try again.",,,

Portland, OR","I found out about Barolo from a very nice lady at the concierge desk at the Westin. So I walked the two blocks and was greeted by a nice host or maybe the restaurant manger. I opted to sit in the bar area because they have an outstanding happy hour. Pro-tip: Even locals come here not just tourists, even though it is in the tourist/business district.
My waitress, Vivian,was so nice and helpful, and we had a fun conversation since it was not too busy. I came around 4 for a late 'lunch' but it did pick up around 5:30.
I had the tuna tartare, which was very fresh and the ginger/spices gives it a nice zing! I actually had this dish twice the week I was in Seattle because it was so good. The Cesar salad was alright, not my favorite salad ever, but I think it had more to do with my taste in salads.
The happy hour is amazing with outstanding drink and food specials. They do have an exceptional variety of food on their happy hour menu and the drinks don't disappoint either.
As outstanding as everything was, the tiramisu was the best. My family has a homemade tiramisu recipe and this may be better...yep I typed that. Seriously I will be back and I will eat dessert first!",,,

Even though there weren't many tables to serve, our waiter was very slow in taking our orders, making and bringing out our drinks, and wasn't at all attentive throughout the meal. Our waiter was more concerned with telling us about how he had to drop off his girlfriend at the airport at 7:00am. You know it's particularly bad when the staff/non-waiters step in to pick up the slack (1 star for them).
The restaurant itself is cute, and their use of the mirrors really helps to make the place feel larger than it is. Their menu has quite the variety, however the quantity of food doesn't warrant the high prices. I understand that this is in the mecca of Amazon's campus, but $19 for 5 pieces of ravioloi? Quantity wise, this is a great place to stop in for a pre-meal, but chances are high you'll still be hungry.
The mojito was tasty, and the bread pudding was delightful (+1 star). If I were to come back, it'd be for those two items (and maybe the steak my co-worker had, but again 5 small pieces for a pricey dish).
My suggestion is: come here if this is an expense you can write off with work, or if you're just craving some bread pudding. Otherwise, look elsewhere.",,,

The service at this place does not meet an upscale restaurant service. They also do not do anything special for you like a decoration at the table or free desert if you have a special occasion even though they confirm that on the phone with you when you make a reservation.

Ordered 2 appetizer dishes the tuna tartare and the Cheese Burata with mushrooms. The appetizers were the only thing that did stand out for the whole evening.
Main course
Ordered the ravioli with mushroom and the rigatoni with lamb. The rigatoni with lamb was a bit salty and did not meet my expectations. However , the ravioli with mushrooms was ok.

Foods
First time? Get the rabbit, it's their best stable dishes here. I never liked rabbit before because it always tasted chewy and drenched in gravy (typical French style). Here, the rabbit is juicy, tender, and with seared flavorings similar to a deep fried quail thigh. A creamy pasta dish. My favorite part was the rabbit's heart as I love organ meats and feel American meat recipes don't call for them enough.
If you're lucky to catch them on their lamb shank special of the day, get it. $35 and large enough to share, though I did see the fellow next to us finished up his.
Dessert
If you love cannoli like my husband, then you should get the cannoli. He seems to really like it.
The bread pudding is good, warm, prepared well, and on the lighter side. It's not your typical American bread pudding drizzled in caramel topped with ice cream.
Service
Outstanding. From hostess to waiters to bartenders to floor manager. It feels like family coming here. Not your pizzeria family, but your upscale cousin's family, haha. Whatever the case, this place will cheer you up on a bad day or the very least, not ruin your good days.
Price
Very reasonably priced. You get your money's worth here. The free focaccia bread alone is worth a visit. They always give us extra to bring home :), it's yummy. And I here their happy hour is one of the best in town. Will have to check that out!

They took one hour to sit us down (we were 4) even though we had reservations.
Then another hour to bring the food. I'm not kidding.
The quality of the food has diminished. And don't expect that the food will be consistent. I came back to eat something I like and in three occasions it was different. How is it possible? One day they add capers the other they remove them and make the sauce creamier (not good) and then the portions are a lot smaller but same price. I mean: come on.

Seattle, WA","Came here with a good friend because we deserve a good meal after a long week of school AND it was a good excuse to try a new place due to Seattle Restaurant week.
ENVIRONMENT - Very very dim. I could barely make out the people's faces at far tables. It's a cozy setting and the place is quite narrow. But it was comfortable and snug in our booth.
FOOD -
Poached pear, mozzarella, with prosciutto - Simple appetizer which I thought was a good way to start a meal. I loved the combination of sweet (from the pear), creamy (from the cheese), and salty (from the prosciutto) flavor that were on the dish.
Italian sausage lentil soup - My friend got this one and I had a bit of it. It's quite sizable for an appetizer and there were good chunks of sausages in it. Good hardy flavor and it filled her up.
Squid ink risotto with baked salmon - I loved the risotto. It's a bit briny and salty from the squid ink but it was also creamy. One of my favorite parts of the meal was this. The salmon was also nice and tender. I overestimate my appetite sometimes so I thought this plate wouldn't fill me up, but it really did!
Chocolate torte - My friend got this one, and the presentation was nice! Simple and decorated with strawberries. The torte is a good amount and was rich in chocolate.
Cannoli - I thought it would be smaller, but it was pretty big! I was also stuffed at this point, so I was thankful the dessert wasn't too large. It was my first time having a cannoli so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but it's very heavy on the cream and the pastry bit was crunchy and hard. I still enjoyed it though!
SERVICE - Made a reservation for 7:15PM and we did arrive on time, but had to wait around 20min before being seated which is fine but ideally, would have liked to be seated sooner since we did arrive before our reservation time. But then again, it was SRW so I know they were packed! Service was good though! Very attentive and would always check in to see how we were doing and gave us good descriptions of the food when we ordered them. A lot of the words, we didn't know (due to our lack of knowledge on foodology terms or lack of Italian) so it was super helpful that the waiter told us what the dish consisted of.

For entrees, I ordered the carbonara. I liked that the dish had pork belly instead of bacon or pancetta like most carbonara dishes. The pork belly was cooked well and added a nice crisp. My boyfriend ordered the ravioli special of the day, which was potato and mushroom ravioli. I personally think his dish was better and would definitely recommend their ravioli.

This place really went down hill. Such a shame. Everything went down. Had 2 extremely warm bottles of wine: even asked for ice. They kept it chill but it was the warmest wine. Seattle's been hot lately. And both bottles of wine tasted like they have been outside.
It wasn't as busy as it used to be in the past either. But our plates weren't cleaned off the table for a long while too. Should've set at the bar with Heidi! But we had a table. The tuna tartare was covered in onions. Way way more onions than there should be. Pasta was a ok too.

It was crowded and I know when I'm eating, I don't want people hovering over me or bumping into me. If they can figure out the waiting issue, this would be great!
Our food and service was top-notch. We shared the arborio' risotto with goat cheese and basil, and I found it to be flavorful; each flavor profile was tasty. I enjoyed the salty goat cheese!

The first time we hit up Happy Hour- super good deals on the bar menu and drink specials. The service was good and the food was absolutely delicious. We ordered more than half the menu and were not disappointed by any of it- standouts were the ahi and the quality of the pasta. The server caught me staring at my hand and asked if I'd just gotten my nails done. Slightly embarrassed I told her We had just gotten engaged and I couldn't stop looking at the beautiful and unique ring my (now) husband had put on my finger. She brought out a chocolate desert at the end of the meal, complete with a fantastic sparkler candle to help us celebrate. It was very special and memorable.
Our trip two days ago was for the full dinner service. We were a group of 6 and they gave us a beautiful semi-private room where we managed to order about half the menu- starting out with many entrees as share plates before settling on individual entrees. Everything was absolutely exquisite. I wanted a different setting for my cut of meat which she happily accommodated. Standouts were the pheasant gnocchi, the rack of lamb, and the filet. All the meat was cooked just perfectly. I'm not normally a pasta eater but the freshness and quality of this pasta is undeniably delicious.
The server was lovely, helpful and very knowledgeable about the wines (impressive, even to the mother of all wine snobs at our table). She was very attentive without being overly-present.
On top of ordering half the menu, we ordered 4 bottles of wonderful wine and every desert. I can't say enough good things about Barolo. It was the best birthday dinner I have ever had and we will definitely be back.o",,,

When reserving the large party, the staff asked what the occasion was and we told them it was for a birthday. We provided them with the name of the person and when we arrived they gave the birthday girl a ""commemorative"" menu with her name and the occasion the top.
The server was very friendly and patient. Our group came slightly late and we didn't feel rushed to order/get things going while we waited for late guests. He came to our name several times throughout the service to make sure we had everything that we needed. It was nice.
The ambiance is perfect for a date night or special occasion, with the dim lighting and slightly upscale decor. It's a place where you could definitely come in wearing jeans and a t-shirt and be accepted, but also come in wearing dress attire and not be over dressed either.
The service, like most Italian restaurants, started with bread and some sort of olive oil-based dipping sauce. It was a little sweet, not my favorite, but it wasn't bad. The bread was good though, it had a little salt on top which made it easy to come back for more. We were a bit disappointed that we weren't offered more after finishing what was brought to the table, though I suppose that would've asked for more.
Of the many items on the menu, I tried one of the daily specials, which was a Squid Ink Pasta in a Pesto Sauce with Scallops and Salmon Roe and the Spaghetti Carbonara.
It was the first time that I had tried Squid Ink Pasta and I really enjoyed it. The pasta was al dente and had a nice salty, umami, flavor that you don't get with regular pasta. The pesto was light and refreshing and paired well with the pasta. There were two large scallops, I could've went for another, because they were perfectly cooked. I did expect a bit more Salmon Roe - and expected it to be atop the pasta, but it was scattered around the plate. Each bit with the Roe has a wonderful salty flavor. It was an extremely umami experience, between the saltiness of the Roe, Parmesan in the Pesto and the pasta itself. I would definitely order this again.
The Carbonara was a classic Carbonara. It was rich, salty, creamy and smoky. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the saltiness and smokiness of the pork paired really well with the creaminess from the eggs. Very good Carbonara.
After the meal they came with a small cake and a sparkler for a candle. It was pretty cool and a nice way to celebrate.
Also, it has a pretty robust wine list as well. Plenty of by glass, half bottle or full bottle options.
All-in-all its a very good restaurant, perfect for a date night or special occasion.
The only real negative is that it's a little expensive, but you could argue that's the trade off for the ambiance and execution for a large party. That being said, Seattle is filled with so many terrific Italian restaurant that serve just as food, if not better pasta, for the same price or less. But, if you don't mind spending a little money, check it out.",,,

Seattle, WA","I was here tonight for my birthday and I was very underwhelmed, my friends who came with me love Italian food and had no interest in this place at the end of the night. I will add that our server named Francisco was extremely rude and aggressive, he was pushing us to order quickly and was rude when we had any questions. Not only that but also he rushed us and he himself was rushed although it was not that busy. For such a large group as ours there should be more assistance and attentiveness given.
I will start with the PROS.
- This place is good for group and large parties especially when you're celebrating a birthday. They bring out a small dessert with a sparking candle on it and it's very special. (Picture below shows our own cake brought)
- the carbonara was very good!! And well made, it was buttery and had the right amount of salt ($23)
- one star was added for the ambiance and the romantic lighting
CONS:
- as stated earlier the waiter was extremely rude and distant, he brushed us off so much that everyone had to comment about it at the table (we do not normally speak of people like that)
- all the other dishes we had including the meat, lamb rag and the bread and appetizers were NOT GOOD.. there are definitely a lot better Italian places to fill the need for some good pasta and bread... this is not it.
This experience was low and I will not be eating here again, I think also the waiter ruined the night for us with his attitude. If you're going to eat here I think it's best to go for HH when the options are good for its prices. Also, you can expect quick service and for the waiter to brush you off more than you would for a sit down dinner with added gratuity.",,,

Bellevue, WA","This is the favorite go to place for my family and me in Seattle. We love the personal attention, we love the food, we love the intimate setting, and we love the atmosphere. The setting is small, intimate and casual. It's like being invited into Pino's house, sitting down, and being served a meal.
On occasion, some of us have spent up to four hours at Pino's, chatting and talking with the Pino regulars who stop by regularly and are like extended family. Pino periodically comes by and sees how things are going, brings out more food, and when the bottle is empty opens another bottle of wine or refreshes the water pitcher.
If you crave luxurious atmosphere, fawning wait-staff, and full-blown menus, this isn't your place. If you want to feel as if you stopped by to visit friends and family in a small southern Italian villa, this should be your spot. To appreciate Cafe da Pino, don't go to get a meal. Go to become part of a family. Because at its best, Cafe da Pino isn't about food; it's about relationship, with food and wine as the lubricant.",,,

An important change - the restaurant is now open for dinner by reservation only. Pino cooks for your reservation, and that is all he prepares. If you walk up, expecting to be seated, you probably won't be. (That happened to one group while we were there.)
If you have some food preferences or restrictions, that needs to be conveyed when you make your reservation.",,,

Seattle, WA","The place across from Cafe da Pino had a 40 minute wait so we went into Pino's to get an appetizer and a drink.
We didn't notice he was actually closed but when we came in he said I'm making sausage, give me 10 minutes. So we waited for him to finish.
He recommended some wine for us and as we got ready to order he asked us if we wanted to order or wanted him to take care of us. We told him please take care of us. When a chef asks that should be the only answer. :)
He served us a couple plates of his house cured meats and homemade cheese. The entree was a bolognese on penne. It was very good. Don't expect this food to be highly spiced with garlic and Italian seasonings. One thing I discovered when travelling through Italy is most of the food doesn't come garlicy or heavily spiced. This tasted authentic.
As we ate some of 'the guys' came by for dinner which made the ambiance friendly and welcoming. We knew we were experiencing something special... which we knew to these guys was 'just Wednesday'.
Dessert was the lemon cake which was made by one of 'the guys'. It was light and not overly sweet and very delicious.
Pino offered some of his lemoncello which was creamy and smooth and we happily killed the bottle for him.
The tab for all that food was reasonable for 4 people: 2 bottles of wine, 3 appetizers, 4 entrees, 2 pieces of cake and about 5 shots of lemoncello came to about $200.
He also will do special woodfired pizza parties. He doesn't use email. He said he uses smoke signals. You have to go in person to arrange anything special.
Pino may come off as a bit rough around the edges but he's very warm and loves cooking for people.",,,

The owner puts my feeble efforts to shame - he is a Chef! The vegetables were perfect, the lasagna superb and the lemon mousse cake exquisite!

Seattle, WA","He's a one-man band and a MacGyver of furnishing patios; Pino is the owner/chef/host/server of Cafe da Pino and the dining experience here is intimate, authentic, and charming. This little osteria is a well-priced gem in Ravenna for delicious, unpretentious Italian. The menu is succinct, just barely over a dozen dishes including insalatas, soups, entrees, and desserts, with the only pasta choice being penne.
We started with the caprese salad: sweet, juicy red and orange tomato slices separated by rounds of tangy mozzarella dressed lightly with balsamic and olive oil and a scattering of dried basil and oregano. This was refreshing and delicious but I was disappointed not to see fresh basil leaves. The penne bolognese was a winner; the meat seasoned impeccably and the pasta al dente and toothsome. If there is a meat dish, order it! Meat is Pino's specialty and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you left without trying the spectacularly flavorful meatballs.",,,

Maybe our problem was how we chose to order off the specials board. My penne with house- made sausage and marinara it was no more memorable than something from a can of Chef Boyardee with some extra fennel seeds thrown in. My partners beet ravioli-$18 for seven pieces!-was drowning in a pink sea of unseasoned flavorless beet goo. You can leave your Kraft shake cheese at home-Pino's already uses plenty of it.

We are by no means foodies, or experts in Italian food (we even enjoy Olive Garden occasionally), but our experience here was extremely poor. I got the tortellini with marinara sauce, and she got the ravioli with cream sauce, peas and prosciutto. The marinara sauce tasted like it was from a jar and the pasta could have been from a Buitoni package. The ""prosciutto"" was flavorless and thick- we think it may have been ham or Canadian bacon. The parmesan was not fresh; it was, no joke, from a Kraft canister. The bread was dry and the service bland. To top it off, the portions are small and the prices high. Where is the authentic Italian food others have mentioned? Extremely disappointed.",,,

I usually order one of the specials. Last night I had the tortellini with peas and prosciutto. Delicious filling in the tortellini and his prosciutto is the best. Got a couple of salamis to take home as well.
Maybe this place isn't for everyone, portions are not huge, but it's my kind of no fuss neighborhood place. The atmosphere is a bit cramped and tacky, and Pino might appear to be a cranky old guy, but he warms up pretty quickly.",,,

Seattle, WA","Pino Rogano is the Calabria native proprietor of this salumeria (Italian cured meat shop / delicatessen) in Ravenna. After several years in Garlic Gulch (Rainier Valley) next to Mondo's Meats he moved back north not too far from his former restaurant that he sold back in 1989 on Roosevelt Way - Verdi's Caffe del'Opera (now Salvatore Ristorante Italiano) to return to Italy to hone his artisan craft of curing meat. He won the best salami at the 1st Annual Salumi Curing Contest locally. He was the chef at the former Settebello. Now he mostly supplies restaurants (Lampreia, Assaggio, Matt's in The Market, to name a few) with his cured meats (Prosciutto, Coppa, Sopressata, Cotecchino, and his specialty wild boar sausage which he sources the meat from Oregon).
I ducked-in (rolled up on my Ducati '05 Monster 1000S) for his daily pasta lunch special for only $8 because I was referred here by a native Italian that dines here regularly and I had the rigatoni with sausage (rigatoni con salsiccia). I also had a Peroni beer (wine available too), Lavazza espresso, and his Limoncello mousse for dessert. He makes the Limoncello in house also and I tried a sampling (Squisito!). I'm told this is the place to go for hot sandwiches too (I'll be back!). It is a tiny quaint place with only 4 tables inside (outside seating available, weather permitting) open for lunch and dinner and closes at 7:30pm (closed Sunday). Ravenna/U.District/U.Village you don't need to go wait in line at lunch for an italian sandwich like those in Pioneer Square/Downtown do at that other salumeria because there's no line here yet.

For the first time, I wonder if we had a bad experience because of some systemic racism. The bartender wouldn't look my direction, was cold in every interaction, and took much longer to attend to us than any other table. The hostesses, despite many open tables throughout our meal, refused to move us to a table as they had reservations elsewhere.
When we placed our order, we noted we wanted to start with some risotto, meaning before the entrees. The bartender gave us a shrug and no apology when it arrived, cold, along with our lukewarm entrees that we ordered.
The food when cold was fine -- not worth giving this place a second chance though.

WA, WA","Italianissimo has been one of my favorite go-to restaurants bringing family, friends and clients since 2000.
I will spend the significant money to relax and enjoy lovely food in a calm atmosphere.
Sadly, the last 2 visits at Italianissimo have been abysmal. Reviewing the online reviews, I noted there is an increasing amount of unhappy customers and there is no management response or apologies to these people.
Last night we arrived at our reservation time and was not greeted by the seemingly high schooler who was the ""host"". There was nothing professional in his appearance or actions as he scrambled for 15 minutes through the restaurant as we waited in the entrance.
We waited another 10 minutes at our table with no water, bread, drinks or attention.
Finally another seeming frantic high schooler/ young man arrived at the table to ask for our drink selection. I asked a question about one of the Italian wines and he did not know the answer.
He was gone for over 10 minutes when he arrived with my glass of wine, it had wine dripping all over it and no wine for my friend. We waited another 10 minutes for her wine to arrive.
We asked twice for Balsamic Vinegar for the cold bread that was unceremoniously plopped on a plate. This took 15 minutes.
It took another 15 minutes for my cup of the signature Shrimp Bisque to arrive and alike my visit from a month ago, it was a thin and quite lackluster facsimile of the typical delicious recipe.
We waited another 20 minutes for our main courses to arrive and mine arrived lukewarm. At the risk of waiting another long period to get it back, I simply gave up and ate a portion.
This young waiter was very nice but obviously poorly trained which is the fault of the management. He constantly apologizing but we were there to relax after a busy week. It was anything but relaxing and we ended up with a high bill. He charged us for an item that we did not get and he did not know how to take it off and there was no one to ask.
Again, Italianissimo has not trained their staff in good customer service.
In years past, they had superlative professional waiters and waitresses where we always felt like welcome guests. Without exception, we always had memorable, relaxing meals.

We ordered the fried calamari to share. I ordered the shrimp bisque and osso buco (braised veal with risotto), while my bf ordered the caesar salad and lasagna. Dinner also comes with complimentary bread served alongside olive oil.
I had my suspicions about this place when the bread came out, because it was cold and wasn't very appetizing. The fried calamari was a bit strange. It came with 3 different sauces that made it seem like a Japanese fusion dish. There was 1 tomato sauce that was very one dimensional. There was also a green sauce that was reminiscent of wasabi, and a salmon colored sauce with roe in it. Sauces aside, the calamari was just okay. The rings could have been much crispier.
I did not like the shrimp bisque. I don't know what was in it, but it had a very soapy taste.
My entree was okay. The braised veal was very tender but I thought it was under-seasoned. The risotto was perfect--very creamy, rich, and flavorful.
I had a bite of my bf's lasagna and it was also okay. The homemade pasta was amazing and very silky, but I was disappointed since it was not nearly as hearty as I was expecting. There is hardly any meat in their lasagna, as it's mostly cheese and it was sitting in a puddle of sauce.
Overall, this was not a bad place to get dinner, but it is not nearly as authentic as I was expecting for Italian food. If we come back in the future, I would opt to try one of their other handmade pasta dishes because that was the only thing I was impressed with.",,,

It was a Saturday night, the six of us were driving by and decided to stop here based on the good reviews to grab some delicious food. When we entered and asked if we could have a table, instead of the hostess letting us know that she had no tables available for us for the rest of the night or what time she could sit us (even if it was not for hours), with attitude she replied ""No"".
We kind of just looked at her, and each other, in silence for a few heart beats thinking maybe she was just joking. Nope, after an abundant amount of awkward silence she started complaining about all of the groups she still needed to sit and that it's just not going to happen for us.

Asking for pasta on the side for eggplant parmigiana and the answer is no. Then we had to ask for pasta on the side again thinking we heard wrong or she may not have understood. She replies""We can't do that."" Finally to just saying that we want to pay for pasta on the side and she finally said they can do it. To requesting for some bread ( took 2 times to ask for it and over 10 minutes). When asking for the 2nd time, this same server was abrasive and said ""You are not the only table"" and your table will receive bread when I get to it. The lack of customer service and kindness was disappointing. Bread finally came after 3rd ask and it was cold.
We asked to talk to manager and she goes to ""oh, you want to talk to the manager and smugly took me over to Sam who acted like he was wanting no part to address the issue of service. Sam made excuses that they had 2 eight tops and eventually he said that was his wife.
If there was a negative zero, this would be their rating.

West Seattle, Seattle, WA","My husband and I have been going to Pizzeria 22 consistently since we moved to West Seattle 4 years ago. The food is absolutely delicious, and the staff is friendly and usually well organized. I typically get one of the vegetarian pizzas and my husband gets prosciutto with arugula. Both of our pizzas come out perfect and piping hot! The prices are very reasonable and the ambiance is solid. Also I love their spicy oil! Delicious!
Pizzeria 22 is not as ""cute"" as Mioposto, but I prefer Pizzeria 22 because the service is MUCH better, and I like the food better. Plus the prices are comparable or lower, and the menu has greater variety.
Note: I knocked off one star because we did have one experience where the service was *really* bad. There was only one waitress for the whole restaurant, and I believe she was new. We waited for a LONG time for her to even take our drink orders, and then much longer than normal for our orders to come. However this has not been my typical experience at Pizzeria 22.",,,

both my husband and myself were really just not digging what we ordered... we didn't say anything but it was obvious as we didn't eat more than a few bites and then were done.
the waitress asked me what was wrong - i said it wasn't for me and she was very nice in offering something else and to take it off the bill; i said i would gladly pay for it and didn't want anything else... she apologized and said it would be off the bill
after this, my husband asked the man for the bill - when he noticed my husband didn't eat any of his food he asked if he wanted a box, my husband (politely) declined and the man apparently was VERY offended by this... asked my husband a few times what was wrong and why he didn't like the food and didn't want to take it home. my husband was very polite in saying he just didn't like it and just wanted the bill... the man then asked if we had ever been here before (does that matter?) we said this was out first time and he scoffed at us. my husband noted he had run a pizzeria for years from where we moved from so he knows pizza (sooooo he knows pizza)... not everything is for everyone was the point we were trying to make but this guy was just PISSED! slammed the bill on the table (my food was still on there but whatever... i just wanted to leave at this point) and didn't say a word to us.
look dude... tastes are different to each person... not saying your food is crappy but your attitude and behavior was out of control and uncalled for.
we eat out ( A LOT) and have never been treated like this... safe to say we'll never be back

In all seriousness, Pizzeria 22 is a great little pizza place hidden in West Seattle. It's fairly priced, and has a pretty large menu with good options for us non-meat eaters. To be honest, the menu is probably my only issue with this place - everything on it looks delicious, but each of the items are a little too similar so it can make it hard to decide on what to order.
Our staff here was friendly, and the restaurant itself has a quality 'ma and pop' feel (read: it's not pretentious, and could be either a low-key date place or somewhere to bring the fam). The wine pours are very generous, and you'll enjoy the large portion sizes of pizza, too. I can't wait to convince my friends in West Seattle to grab pizza with me again!",,,

I had never heard of Pizzeria 22, but that's also probably because I can count the times I've been to West Seattle on my two hands. The location is sort of hidden on a side street and requires street parking or there is a lot right across the street where you can pay to park ((+++ it's mobile pay to park!)).
The restaurant is pretty small and split into two sections. The main entrance leads you right into the bar with some tables and and around the corner is the bigger area with more seating and where we took over for the lovely evening. It was nice that the place wasn't crowded as we were able to walk around and mingle.
The drinks were strong! I ordered a Frizzante which I anticipated would be on the lighter side since it was Prosecco with vermouth and Campari. But man was it strong! It was very tasty but I ended up sipping on it throughout the entire evening. Expect heavy pours! Of course this is not a bad thing!
Everyone was super thrilled with their pizzas but mine was SPECTACULAR! Order the Quattro Formaggi + Prosciutto - Olive Oil, Fresh Mozzarella, Goat Cheese, Gorgonzola, Grana, Cherry Tomato, Garlic, Fresh Basil & Oregano -$20 YUM!! I love that they give everyone scissors to cut their slices, adds a nice touch.

Wonderful accommodating staff! Pizza is great, cal-zone are even better and they have large pours for mixed drinks.
The pizza has a great burnt crust that has great texture and kind a reminds me a bit of naan bread. They have some spicy oil that you can have to drizzle on the pizza that provides a good hit of spicy when mixed with the red pepper flakes.
Inside seating can be a bit cramped when the bar stools are occupied as leaves little space between bar and wall seating. I couldn't imagine all the bar stools & wall seating filled to capacity as it would appear like a Boeing 737.

That being said, I LOVE their pizza and I just can't justify docking a star. The only reason I would is the service. Sometimes, if you come during peak hours, the service is just terrible. One time I ordered a pizza for takeout, they told me it'd be 20 minutes, when I got there, I had to wait AN HOUR for my pizza.
So I mean, that was my worst experience there. But I keep coming back for more because their pizza is just so damn good. Honestly, closest thing I've found to true Italian pizza in Seattle.
I ordered the maragharita DOC pizza, it's one of my favorites. But I've also had the radicce which is amazing.

Long Beach, CA","Just moved to west Seattle and decided to give this place a try and not only are we disappointed in the food, but the service was out of control horrible. We started with the stuffed mushrooms which were just okay... heavy on the ricotta but par for the course. They where bland and flavorless. My wife got the caprese salad which were whole stewed tomatoes and a ball of mozzarella... I think covered in pesto. I liked it but my wife didn't. I got a pepperoni pizza which again was bland and flavorless. We didn't like our dinner which is fine, we were trying something new....The way the owner (?) I am assuming, acted when he found out we didn't like our food was like a five year old! He was clearly under the influence of alcohol, and he got mad at us and started to argue with us about not liking the food. He slammed the bill down on the table like a lunatic than after we paid he started pushing chairs around as we left. I have never in my life been treated so awfully for not liking food before. Hey pizzeria 22, your food was terrible and you don't know how to treat people. No one should come here. Stay away from this place and the owner or manager or whatever he is mentally disturbed.

Needless to say, I'm glad we stopped in for dinner. The atmosphere is split with the front being more dark and intimate and the other side being more open. Either way, the staff is on top of it with speed and recommendations. This is a traditional Neapolitan style pizzeria with exceptional starters, salads, and obviously pizza.
For two, I recommend getting the clams (local PNW caught - fresh) and veal meatballs as starters. Follow with the insalata verde (green salad with pancetta and gorgonzola). Finally, end with a pizza (any are great).

As a grabbed my 2 boxes to go (1 ceasar salad 1 prosciutto pizza) it occurred to me that these boxes are lighter than air and actually wondered if anything was in them?
Upon arriving at me house I was happy to see there actually was pizza and salad in there.
The salad was good but not sure it was 10.00 good. Fresh, large cut romaine, a few house made croutons, some shaved parm... the normal. But dang dudes... that's a handsome price for a single salad.
The pizza on the other hand tasted good. Very sparse with the toppings but they all worked well together. The outside crust would be exactly what I want with a wood fired pizza, crunchy...doughy...Yep. The bottom crust was super thin and soft (whaa whaa whaa) and in no way could hold up to the weight of the sauce and toppings. Even to fold it - it still pointed south as to say it doesn't want to go into my mouth.
All in all the meal was good, but not sure if it was 50.00 good (including tip) but I think I would like to dine in and try their pasta. Maybe better luck, I'll let you know",,,

There's a little cafe by the street that you can get pizza, pasta, etc. but the other side of the store has a huge mix of wines, cheese, crackers/breads, oils, you name it to pick from.
The pick of cheeses are almost overwhelming and just in the right corner of the assortments, they have the option of a cheese and charcuterie board or ""the cone"" that's perfect for one person. They give you an option of two meats to pick from (I picked the smoked prosciutto) and just the one cheese option they have for the day. The cheese option for that day was a hard one but I love soft cheeses so I asked for a small cut of a Camembert cheese and they happily added it to my cone for me! You also get a few bread sticks and olives to go with it. It makes for a cute display but also a delicious snack on the go!
I wish I had stumbled upon this place before walking the whole right side of the market so that I could've snacked on these while I shopped around.

When you first walk in, it looks like a grocery store with a deli, but there is also a wine bar upstairs and the deli has lots going on for it. We decided to make a little picnic meal here and purchased a baguette, a couple cheeses and some freshly sliced salami from the deli. Perhaps the reason I love this shop so much is that the staff is super knowledgeable. The cheesemonger helped us select cheeses and charcuterie that were compatible and complimentary of one another. We even brought in our own jam from another one of the Pikes Place stands, and he helped us pair the cheeses based off the flavor profile of the jam. He was spot on, and it was one of my favorite meals of all time (which is saying a lot).

Weekends and holidays can get a little packed here but the staff here do their best to give customers great service while not taking too long to get to the next customer.

In the back, near the meats and cheese, we saw the charcuterie plates, they had an actual wooden plate with two different kind of cheeses, prosciutto, olives and bread for $25 which we though was a bit expensive for the amount of food you're given, but we noticed that the plate was included, ergo the price. We opted for two charcuterie cones for $9 each and they were so worth it.

When they could see that I wasn't going away, the dark haired gal went searching around, found salt and placed it in the condiment area.

The Arrosto - Roast beef, gruyere cheese, truffle aioli was my favorite.
Tacino Turkey, provolone, roasted tomato aioli, and arugula
They both were made with fresh crusty bread which had a nice crunch because it was placed in a panini press. Like true european sandwiches they are not heavy on the meat, but rather the bread, meat, cheese and spread come together as a balanced bite. Each sandwich also came with a few olives, which i thought were a nice touch.

They also have a deli counter with cheeses and cured meats. The people behind the counter give wonderful recommendations and are perfectly happy to give out samples.

Its one of those things that everyone can make but if you want to perfect it, there's so many variables to consider and it really is an art form. Just like a red sauce at an italian restaurant or fried rice at a chinese restaurant. This place uses the perfect balance in dough for a balance chewy and crunch. Its not overly sweet and the high quality dark chocolate adds a perfect compliment to pair with a cold glass of milk. The hazelnut tops it off and they use very fresh hazelnuts.

We tried The Olive and Grape for the first time while deciding if Joe Exotic was really guilty. SPOILERS AHEAD FOR TIGER KING.
I just played TWANGY for 29 points in Scrabble. Shelter in place has us watching crazy television and ordering take out. With tonight's order we had: 2 lamb trios, 1 chicken kebab, 2 Greek salads, 1 green bean salad and 1 order of baklava (comes with 2 pieces).
TLDR: delicious through and through, but as 3 recent college grads, don't know if we'd go again back consistently for the price.
For someone who isn't very adventurous with meat, the chicken shawarma was so tender and delicious. I actually ate all the mushrooms in the rice, which I would never do. Felt a little shafted that adding the Greek salad instead of green bean salad was an additional cost, which was not listed on the website.
""The long strip of meat was my favorite"" one of my friends said about the lamb trio.
""Kebob style was better"" my other friend described the lamb trio.
""The beef was holding the meatballs back"" both said about the third son of the lamb trio.
On the bright side of things, my friend who favors her meat in strips accurately described the baklava as what freedom will taste like after a quarantine.
As for Tiger King, Joe Exotic was absolutely framed by Jeff Lowe. I mean C'MON, you really think that Allen would have gone and killed a woman for the worst boss he's ever had??",,,

We usually visit Kalia next door or Razzi's across the street. But I have driven past The Olive and Grape for several years in Seattle's Greenwood neighborhood...figured it's time to give it a try.
We had 5pm reservations and were seated a few minutes prior. Literally within the first half hour, the entire restaurant was full. I was impressed by the interior, the wait staff, and especially the two men working the kitchen line having to deal with the onslaught of diners showing up around the same time.
Beverages: Coke, local beer on tap, and me sticking with water
Starters: two orders of calamari and one order the Turkish platter with pita, dolma, borek, and a grilled lamb skewer.
Entrees: Chicken Parmigiana with pasta, Lamb Shank with potato puree, and Fruitti di Mare with pasta
Dessert: two orders of baklava (generous two triangles) and one order of tiramisu (used Turkish coffee vs. espresso)

I love their appetizers; especially the scrumptious fried cauliflower, and the lamp pieces on a stick. They are so tender and delicious, I often make a meal of just appetizers. And then there is that scrumptious lamb steak smothered in a light mushroom sauce. Delectable!

We came for Seattle Restaurant Week. They were fairly busy because of this and only seemed to have 2 waitresses which made service a bit slow.
Ended up sharing everything on the 3 course menu with my 2 friends so we got to try 9 things in all which was a great way to do it.
Grilled shrimp appetizer was good but nothing super different than other places. I'm not vegetarian but our eggplant dish and portobello dish were great. I didn't miss the meat since they were both so flavorful.

To start, I had the aperol spirtz, they bring me my drink and there is a bug literally crawling in it. I thought I was crazy but I showed it to everyone at my table and they all agreed. Of course they kindly replaced it but yikes!
Service was also atrocious. They seemed rushed, frantic and angry with each other and frankly us. For example, when dishes were placed in front of the wrong diner (ie I ordered the seafood duo but they gave it to the person across from me and gave me someone else dish) they acted as if it was our fault. I didn't care and would gladly swap with my co-diners after all of the dishes were brought out but instead one of the other servers came and yelled at the other right in front of us and then he corrected it and said to the entire table in a very snarky voice ""is that correct, can I trust you guys?"" Also, service was incredible slow.
Food was also very subpar and they frankly ignored what we ordered. I ordered an arugula salad and asked for dressing on the side. I got the exact opposite. My salad was swimming in salad dressing to the point that it was draining into a large pool at the edges of the plate.
The seafood duo was also just doused in oil and salt. Flavorful but I'm sure my blood pressure went up a good 20 points.
Dessert was baklava and gelato and it was tasty but the baklava was very hard and we all struggled to cut into our pieces.

I've never been but I saw the photos on Yelp and got really excited about having a sandwich from there. It was already 8 pm but Google said they close at 8 pm and Yelp says 10 pm. We called and the nice guy on the other end said 8:30! We were all the way at Ikea so I was a little worried we wouldn't make it in time.
We managed to get there at around 8:20 pm! We both ordered the Turkey Gobbler. The man taking our order (possibly the owner) was so friendly and seems to really take pride in his sandwiches!
It only took a few minutes until both of our sandwiches were made and we could head home to enjoy them. Once we got home, oh man, that cream cheese with the cranberry inside of the sandwich hit the spot. For me, the sandwich was pretty big so I only had half and saved the other half for lunch the next day. I love extending sandwich goodness to the next day!

I've been here twice and each time, I've left very satisfied with my meal. The staff here are really friendly and helpful. On my last visit, I couldn't have been more welcomed.
I love my sandwiches full of meats and cheeses and the Italian Meat Trio is the definition of my perfect sandwich. Salami, Pepperoni, and Ham piled on top of each other topped with provolone, black olives, oil and vinegar and other fixings. The best part is probably the Pub Roll that holds everything together. The bread is denser than your typical sub roll, but much softer than french bread without tearing the roof of your mouth. All the sandwiches are a hearty portion and fitting for the blue collar workers working down there. If you're not into Italian Sandwiches, I'd also recommend their Meatloaf Sandwich Tim's Way. It's definitely a slice of Americana.
The only minor drawback is the decor. This place is a hole in the wall and desperately needs a facelift. The booths are torn and need to be reupholstered and the individual tables look older than most college students. Some cosmetic changes could go a long way.
Despite the interior, I'm ok with the way it currently looks as long as it continues to make awesome sandwiches. It's a very underrated shop for a very underrated part of the city. If you're near the Industrial District/SODO area, definitely stop by for lunch or grab a sandwich to go.",,,

The Good: The service was nice, I was helped right away and the lady behind the counter was knowledgeable and helpful with her recommendations.
The Bad: I really hate writing bad reviews but I was in shock with this place. First of all, the place was pretty dingy. Run-down, obviously needed some renovations, but I can look past that part due to the building and area of town. Parking isn't great unless you're lucky enough to snag a street spot out front. Anyway, when I was walking in there was an older man outside screaming at a car as it drove by. Cursing, yelling slurs, hysterically laughing. I just thought it was a scruffy off beat regular or a homeless dude hanging out inside. Then the dude came in, went behind the counter, WITHOUT washing his hands, and started making sandwiches. Honestly that should have been red flag enough for me to get up and leave but I already paid 9 bucks for my food so I waited a little while longer. I get home, open the sandwich, take a couple bites. Everything is good so far, and a piece of lettuce falls out my sandwich with a DEAD FLY!!! Seriously WTF!!!! I've had a hair in my food, I've had random pieces of who knows what in my food before, but never a fly. I threw the rest away after that but oh man I was so grossed out.
My partner ended up calling the restaurant to get an explanation of their food storage situation or honestly anything, but the lady on the phone had 0 empathy and barely apologized. No offer to make another sandwich, no offer of a refund, nothing.

First time I was given artichokes instead of anchovy, pretty disappointing but oh well, the restaurant apologized, offered 25%off a future order and Slice offered $7 credit. So far just fine, nobody's perfect. Next day I figure I'll give them a shot at redemption while using up the discount and credit since it's a cheat weekend on keto for me so I didnt want to wait forever to use those up and wanted to give Modena a chance to make good on their error. This time the pizza was NOT EVEN CLOSE to what I ordered. As you can see in the photo, this time ""half sausage anchovy half pepperoni"" (input using the guide on the app that clearly shows which half to put toppings on and everything) translated to a full pizza of ""sausage, pepperoni, mushy Canadian bacon and white sauce"". This time they offered me a 10% discount on a future order...??? Like why the hell would I come back again after twice failing in a row and offering less of a fix than the first time?

Seattle, WA","This is my go-to location for deliveries. They do not have a delivery fee and have a $15 minimum, which is easily met with a medium pizza.
The only pizza I have tried from this location remains to be my favorite pizza in Seattle-- the Red Goat Pizza with red onions, red peppers, and goat cheese on regular crust and marinara. The flavors complement each other very well. This is an easy vegetarian option I order whenever I'm not feeling in the mood for meat. If I want to add a little more ""substance"" to the pizza, I add mushrooms (easy to do through the app).
I have branched out and tried a couple appetizer/side dishes to accompany my Red Goat pizza. The spicy garlic prawns are soooooooooo good. They have a nice kick and I usually put these on top of some freshly made linguine to divide into two meals. There's plenty of sauce to make this happen, and for that I am very appreciative. The cauliflower is ok. It was a bit bland for my taste but I still ate it, so yay veggies. Modena used to have a lobster ravioli as well and that was delicious. I didn't see it on the menu this last time I ordered, but hopeful it will come back.

Seattle, WA","TLDR: generous proportions.
Tip: Pasta comes with garlic bread and soup or salad. Half order of the garlic bread appetizer is 2 pieces vs 4 from a full order.
Small authentic Italian restaurant with mellow Italian music playing. Limited dining area--7 tables. Clean place. Most orders are to go.
Menu is all text. Sorry you visual folk--no pictures but the descriptions are ok.
Don't order too much especially if you get the pasta--it comes with garlic bread and soup or salad. The pasta proportions are pretty generous. Order it first and if you're still hungry, order more. Don't over order!
Service: wait to be seated, order at the table, leftovers will be boxed for you, check brought to table.
Italian Sausage Soup: a Soup of the day item. Sausage is homemade and has a delightful taste and spice. Tiny pastas in the clear broth are so satisfying to the palate. Perfect for warming up on a cold day!
Fettuccini Salmon: I love the capers! Salmon was a bit on the salty side but the fettuccine and sauce help counter it. The sauce is not too thick and is lightly flavored with garlic. I just wish there were more veggies.
Garlic bread: soft, light and fluffy with a slight outer crisp. Not too salty and has satisfying spices sprinkled on top.
Italian Sausage Pomodorini: Sausage is delicious and has a slight kick. The sauce is a bit on the tangy side--lots of tomato chunks. You might find yourself reaching for water or more bread with this one.
Tiramisu: homemade. Very light and fluffy! Not too sweet but enough to satisfy your sweet tooth. I kinda wished there was slightly more coffee flavor though. You know how when you eat tiramisu you can taste the individual layers as they hit your palate? This one, though it was tasty, had a more uniform taste--like the flavor soaked into the cake.",,,

Walking in, we could already tell from the smell alone that this was going to be a fantastic dining experience. The owner of the restaurant was at the front desk and was very welcoming and helpful to us first timers. He walked us through the menu, and even had a laugh with us about how much food we ordered lol. They don't have servers at the restaurant but their kitchen staff doesn't make it seek that way - They cook, serve, and entertain. This family style restaurant will woo you over with their fresh ingredients and their tasty dishes. The first thing that arrived at our table was the salad. Very bright green veggies, paired with their light blue cheese dressing (they have other dressings of course). The taste set my appetite just right. We were so glad to find that our pizza would come shortly after as well as our pastas. They even gave us complimentary tiramisu which was just to die for. Thank you for such an amazing experience Modena!",,,

One bite (everybody knows the rules)
Very flavorful and tasty cheese
Which act as a perfect blanket
For the best salami and Canadian bacon I've ever had on a pizza
This is by far some of the best pizza I've ever had on the west coast
I would recommend this for an impressive dinner that is surprisingly quickly made and delivered for how much of a punch the pie packs.

I called immediately and was told my next pizza would be free of charge. Two weeks later I try and make good on the offer and now they claim they were only giving me the topping for free.
Let me get this straight, I order a pizza with hardly any of the topping I paid for and now you'll send me that topping for free as long as I pay for another pizza? Thanks but no thanks. Bad pizza and worse customer service.",,,

The standard my gf and I usually get is the pepperoni paint job. We then add olives and red onions to it so it has some balance to compliment all the tasty and crispy pepperoni. Your toppings are really all personal preference but their pepperoni and Wisconsin brick cheese blend are good places to start.
They also have some really good brunch pizza on weekends and you can order by the slice as well if you don't want leftovers. Definitely a must hit up spot for pizza fans in the area.",,,
Breezy Town Pizza,(312) 884-9527,"Jennifer O.
Seattle, WA","Pretty solid pizza. Not exactly my definition of deep dish but it'll do.
Food: I'm spoiled by Little Star Pizza / Blueline in the bay, so have high standards when it comes to deep dish. While this was a tasty pie, it didn't meet my hurdle to be considered deep dish. I'd call it more of a thick crust pan pizza. I got the pepperoni pizza with mushrooms added. The pepperoni was delicious but it was a little too meaty. I wish they had a combo pizza like most places offer. Building it on my own would've taken the price through the roof.
Service: I placed my order online and opted to pick up since I live outside of the delivery service area. My pizza was ready an hour after ordering; a very long time but I get it... high demand due to covid. The confirmation email I got mentioned I'd be able to pick up my pizza curbside, but I still had to get out and grab my pizza as no one was waiting on the sidewalk. Bummer since parking was not the easiest.
Atmosphere: I think this restaurant is located in a bar? No idea since I didn't go inside. Will have to update once we can go to restaurants again!
Overall - good pizza, not deep dish, but best I've had in seattle thus far",,,

Seattle, WA","Though I'm not a fan of Chicago style deep dish pizzas, I cannot help but commend Breezy Town Pizza for making the experience so enjoyable that it merits at least 4 stars.
Breezy Town Pizza is... really easy to miss if you're walking by it. We ended up ordering takeout on one occasion, and the only way I can describe the pizza is as a large cheesy bread with toppings. But oh boy can they make a cheesy bread with toppings!
The whole thing was layered with texture: as you bite through the toppings you reach the nice fluffy midsection before ending with another satisfying but light crunch at the end. The whole dough is well seasoned and flavorful in itself, avoiding the pitfall of diluting the entire experience of the pizza.
While Chicago pizza isn't usually my first choice, Breezy Town Pizza has somehow found its way as one of my more enjoyable pizza experiences in Seattle.",,,

Maybe it was just the difference toppings? Maybe the dough tasted a bit different? I'll get back to you after I've tasted them side-by-side. However, the pizza archetype is the same as Windy City: There's going to be a pizza with a fluffy, almost-cake-like-dough covered in a soup of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever toppings you choose. The outer perimeter is going to have a thin, blackened, crispy layer that imparts texture and flavor. And it's going to taste great.",,,

I usually like thin crust with big bubbles which is lighter but this is ridiculously good and satisfying. I almost wished I hadn't had it because it is so good it makes me throw my low carb lifestyle to the side. The price is good. I send pictures of it to my friends to make them jealous. It heats well in the oven at home. The bottom crust is crunchy. The crust is tasty, the sauce is also flavorful without being over powering. The cheese is great but the best thing may be getting the little crispy pepperonis on top. Ok, the best thing is the crunchy cheese on the sides. There are many great things about this pizza. It is worth a cheat weekend. It does feed three, or one for three meals.",,,
Breezy Town Pizza,(312) 884-9527,"Isaac H.
Stevens, Seattle, WA","Worth it.
BTP is worth a trip from the city. It's worth the mild L on atmosphere, which is a grungy, red-lit, sparsely decorated concert space that's a bar first and a restaurant second. It's worth the price point, ~$30 after tax for a pie for three. It's worth the wait, which can be 30-40 minutes of cook time for an impromptu walk-in.
There's just no better pizza. Nothing that I've tried in Seattle - or New York for that matter - can match the crusted cheese edge, the sourdough crust, and the incontrovertible degree of witchcraft oozing into every bite. We've all heard that the real Windy City's pizza is overrated, so I don't feel the need to look elsewhere.
Tips:
1) If you're dining in (recommended because delivery through Caviar is subject to extra fees), order online in advance! The site allows you to schedule a dine-in so that you minimize the time spent agonizing over other tables getting their pies before yours. Egoists will delight as under-prepared table-neighbors comment, ""how did they get their food first if they just arrived?""
2) Extra cheese. Do it.",,,

The food is inside a bar in the back near the stage area. That might be a little confusing but once you know, you know!
You can order a giant pizza for $20+ or just by the slice for $5+. The slices change and new flavors are posted in the board to the right of the register.
I tried the poutine pizza and it was alright. I like the idea of gravy and fries in a pizza but the gravy was lacking for me. I tried it, that's all that matters.
As for the pepperoni paint job, I was happy with my slice. I was hoping there'd be a tad more tomato sauce on it though. The crust was crispy and the pepperoni were crispy as well. Definitely a redemption from the poutine!

It is a dive bar kind of feel, just very laid back. The pizza took 30-35 mins to make which they warn you when you order. The pepperoni on the pizza was amazing, the kind that curls up and reminds you of childhood. I love the crust on the pizza, because the cheese melts and makes a crunchy texture. I mean who doesn't love cheese and bread?! My boyfriend and I ordered one whole pizza and we could only finish 4/6 of the slices.

Seattle, WA","Yum! As a fan of all types of pizza from deep dish to foldable NYC pizza this place has carved a special niche. I would say this is a bit of a Detroit style pizza merged with pan pizza to form that nice crust on the outside and a pillow top of dough to hold the tomato and cheese and toppings. The pepperoni, were on point with the right amount of curl and form little cups.
They have a few other options by the slice and even some brunch pizza options. They are connected to a bar/music venue and I bet it can get packed but going on a Saturday morning it was crowded.

I've been hearing through the coffee vine that I ought to check out this joint, but kept sleeping on it, though I regret it, because this establishment brings life to Beacon Hill!
I visited on a Sunday afternoon, and upon arrival the energy was very welcoming and engaging. The bartender was super tentative with greeting customers, and the restaurant manager, Brandon was incredible by helping introduce me to the menu. It amazes me how the team works together to create new pizza creations weekly and crafts them together for the menu!
During my visit I tried;
1. Arugula & Beets Salad
2. Reverse Marg Pizza Slice
So the salad literally made my mouth water as I was eating! I loved how fresh the greens were, and the beets were pickled to perfection! To top it off was the the blue or Gorgonzola cheese, which was enough to get me really comfortable before my slice. Yum!
The pizza slice I had was called the ""Reverse Marg"" which came with pesto base, fresh mozzarella, and fresh tomatoes! Yoooo, the pizza was amazing, from the first bite to the last. Those fresh flavors came together so greatly, and I seriously enjoyed the caramelized crust. Also, I couldn't help but compliment how I felt the pesto was single handily made for ME! Lol.
Beyond the delicious food, this place does special events, live music, and even trivia nights! So check it out!

My boyfriend and I got the pepperoni deep dish. It was so saucy, loaded with delicious marinara! It tastes fresh, the ratios of everything were just right, and I crave this pizza often. I dont know the wait time for a single slice of pizza but we ordered a whole one and it took about 45mins, I think its worth the wait. But its literally o much pizza and its so filling I think one slice is what I'm gonna go for when I come in.
As for the customer service, the servers were nice and straight to the point. The environment is much bigger than I ever expected. I was reading the flyers around the place and I think they have entertainment nights of karaoke, live music, and etc. Its very cute.

The flavor profile balance of cheese and sauce could improve. Acidic sweet sauce and bland cheese. Salty pepperoni so it balances the dough well. Cheesy and greasy. Very heavy with ciabatta crust and greasy pepperoni.
Delicious! You'll have to wait about 25 minutes if they aren't too busy so don't come starving. Their Ceasar salad is good and is a decent portion size. We also ordered the popcorn which was pretty good too, but it could have used more cheddar flavor.",,,

Seattle, WA","As Windy City Pie fans, we decided to give Breezy Town Pizza a second try after our first experience with the soggy, wet bottom a few months ago. Full disclosure, the Mgr, David, was super nice and reached out to me after my review last time. So we ordered pizza online for lunch (incredibly easy, including pickup time with a confirmation email sent to you)--this time instead of Pete and Pete, we got the Meatballs. As soon as I got to the counter, the pizza was virtually waiting for me, hot out of the oven. I was in and out within just a few minutes, so efficient. Love it!...oh, and did I mention there is easy 2hr parking adjacent to all the restaurants/bars across the street? On our way home, this time there was no moisture on my lap or dampness collecting on the box. I peeked inside and it was steamy perfection (see pic below). Don't let the dark (almost black) edges deceive you--it is crispy, cheesy yumminess that you die for with the corners of lasagna or baked mac and cheese. Both my husband and I agreed--Meatballs is spicy, like 4/5 stars, which we like...and for some reason the Pete and Pete, which is also spicy is somehow mellowed out by the pineapple sweetness maybe? So if you like spicy and you eat red meat, this pizza is for you!--tender, juicy, mmm...not overpowering spicy, but I was on the verge of sweating. Like Windy City Pie, this is a hefty pie for 2--be prepared for lots of leftovers. But don't fret, heats well, esp in Air Fryer. Thanks, David, for your kindness... and I am so glad the soggy bottom the last time was just a one off. We will definitely be back to Breezy Town Pizza again (and again...and again)!

I recently went here for dinner at the suggestion of a date and I could have sworn that it was the first time coming to this location.
Seeing my original review made me chuckle!! Definitely remember chillin' with my coworkers, but as for the actual restaurant? Yeah...no.The fact that I said that what I ate was ""unremembered"" was basically an understatement -- I'd completely forgotten that I'd ever stepped foot in this place until I saw my old review!
I will say that this go around was better. Food? Still the same frozen/bagged reheated stuff that you get in all the national chains. It was, for the most part, just as unremembered as the time before it...though I could have sworn I used to actually like their bread sticks??! Definitely have no desire to eat them again. Ever.
Definite improvement in the service. Nothing overly fancy - just the same average service that I'd expect to get from anyone that wants to keep their job. It's enough that I'll go ahead and bump up to 3 stars, even though this place really is a 2.6 or so.

Ordered the neverending pasta bowl. Started with soup for me and salad for my wife. Took awhile to come and bowl didnt seem that full. My wife dropped her knife and by the time Hunter our waiter got back my soup was done. So either the bowl was a smaller portion, he took a long time or some combination of both.
Hunter brought out breadsticks later but nit snall plates that usually accompany them. Finally got our pasta bowls. The first round spaghetti meat sauce and Italian sausage. I thought the sauce was kinda skimpy for the amount of spaghetti. The second round was even more so.
My wife seemed satisfied with her fettuccine creamy mushroom and chicken fritta. Took some time to get refills bit didnt appear to be busy.
I put my empty glass of water to the edge of the table thinking itd be enough of a hint for a refill but was proven wrong by Hunter.
We were winding down was expecting Hunter to come offer some to go boxes but that was a no go. Pushed the call server button on the little table kiosk. Honestly don't know why its even there. The wait staff seem to just ignore it. After about 15 mins the Mighty Hunter returned!
I asked for some to go boxes. My wife asked for a bag for the bread sticks and a bag to put it all in. Hunter returned with a bread bag only and shot off not to be seen again.
Not sure why we got snubbed because as mybwifw pointed out Hunter was extremely attentive to the table across from us offering up to go boxes, extra breadsticks and a fresh boxed salad for the couple to take home.
Never got the water refill and had to ask the Order pick up station if I could get a bag as Hunter didnt see fit to fullfill our request. The woman said sure grabbed a bag and out it in the counter. Didnt offer to put the boxes in it but asked if we wanted some mints.
I said oh...yet another thing Hunter forgot to offer us. I siad you used to have good service but not anymore. A woman who appeared to be the manager asked the emplouee what was the matter. Not sure why ahe didnt just ask us as we were standing right there.
The employee told her that we had gotten bad service...then the woman just stood there. I guess she didnt know what to do. So we just left.",,,

I had the fagioli soup which I've been ordering for over 10 years. One bite. No taste. None. Aside from the grated cheese on top. I could not believe my taste buds. How you can mess something up that clearly is bagged and shipped to the store and they simply need to just heat it up? I couldn't take another bite.
I ordered original spaghetti with meat sauce. I was so surprised to see the noodles swimming in no other than watered down sauce.

I ordered the Chicken Giardino, which consists of chicken, vegetables, and pasta in a light herby lemon sauce. It instead tasted like what I imagine lemon Pledge or lemon Pine-sol would taste like. It was absolutely disgusting.

Seattle, WA","22 people descended on Olive Garden to celebrate a birthday - at dinner time. The wait was nearly an hour but the wait staff were all very gracious, patient, and courteous. I think there were 4 or 5 staff waiting on us. My only complaint - I asked for a glass of Moscato wine, and was told they were all out. So I asked for a tall gin & tonic. She didn't know what that was. I explained and she looked confused. So I told her to never mind, just give me a short. She didn't understand that either. She cane back and asked me what kind of gin I wanted. I told her to just give me the house gin. Again, she gave me a pained look. She finally said she would talk to her manager. Sigh...
I ordered spaghetti with a creamy mushroom sauce. Husband ordered spinach dip, minestrone soup and salad. Finally, after I was nearly half finished with my meal, my tall gin & tonic came. It was quite strong! But good.
Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal. I'm in a good mood and not taking off stars even for the gin & tonic mishap. There were a lot of us and I'm sure it must be stressful trying to please a big group.

Took forever to get our drinks. I wished at that point we would have left. Our appetizer came out at same time as soup and salad and it wasn't good. The stuffed mushrooms were dry and not really stuffed. Then the food came. My boyfriend ordered extra cheese on his lasagna and didn't get it and it wasn't hot. My spaghetti had a spoonful of sauce and I didn't eat it. Our waitress was pretty much non existant.

Seattle, WA","I don't spend much time in West Seattle so I was excited to try a new spot with friends!
We had a reservation at 12:30 and they were very accommodating, especially considering that our large group was slightly scattered.
As members of our crew trickled in our waitress was great at keeping the Mimosa Carafes ($35 for a bottle of bubbly + your choice of orange juice or grapefruit juice) coming. I appreciated how the juice is served separately so you can add as much, or as little as you want. Just a splash anyone?
We ended up splitting a couple Mixed Fruit plates (~$6) while deciding what to order for the main event. Each fruit plate included a handful of tasty blueberries, along with cantaloupe cubes, thinly sliced apple (or crisp pear?) and citrus. There was a generous dollop of whipped cream and a subtle refreshing mint flavor as well. The blueberries were the best part... the melon wasn't quite ripe and could have used a day or two longer hanging out at room temp to develop a sweeter taste and a softer texture.
Although the ""Huge Pancake"" sounded tasty I went with a lighter option and ordered the Yogurt and Granola ($8). The shallow bowl included thick and creamy yogurt, a few blueberries, a dollop of whipped cream, and a smattering of granola, which was really more like muesli. I enjoyed the yogurt and blueberries, although it would have been nice if more fresh fruit was thrown in the bowl. I do prefer granola over muesli too but it wasn't too big of a disappointment--the muesli was composed of oats (raw perhaps?), toasted walnuts and a small amount of dried fruit.
Overall my food was good, but not spectacular. I do try to eat primarily plant-based but there weren't many vegan options on the menu. My friends' breakfast sandwiches, scrambles and english muffins looked pretty good though!
Service was great, no complaints there. The atmosphere is modern and bright while staying on the casual side.
I'd happily come back to try more items on the menu.",,,

Restaurant Week 3 course menu $35/person
Starters for the table
- I'm used to just picking your own starter, but here you get all 4 to share. What a great deal!
- Seared Tuna: I didn't try this because fish.
- Organic Greens: A pretty good salad. I wouldn't order it just because I rarely order salads at a restaurant, but I wouldn't complain if it was included as a side or starter.
- Risotto: Yummy and flavorful. I'd enjoy this as a full entree even.
- Pork Rillette: I had googled this beforehand to see if I wanted to choose it. I didn't think I'd like it because apparently it's similar to pate. But it was more like braised or pulled pork consistency, and salty. I ended up really liking it!
Choice of Entree
- Tonnarelli: This reminds me of cacio e pepe (cheese and pepper) pasta. It was very creamy. I found it a little too peppery.
- Braised Beef Cheeks: They were out of duck confit, so this was the substitution. I only tried a small bite, but it was very tender.
Choice of Dessert
- Since there was 3 of us, we each ordered a different option so that we could try all 3.
- Chocolate Fritters: They are like chocolate donut holes. I don't care for chocolate cake or donuts that much (would rather have vanilla or another flavor), so I just thought these were OK. I did really like the dulce de leche sauce though.
- Sorbet: Blueberry was the only offered flavor, and I think you'll like it if you really like blueberry.
- Cheese: Baked Brie with a crouton. I love Brie so this was tasty! I like it gooey but since it hardens as it cools, it's like a challenge to eat it when it's still hot but not too hot.
Drinks
- Westside $12: I don't remember the taste now that it's been a couple days, but I liked it the most of the 3 drinks our table ordered.
- Green Light $13
- Improved Whiskey Cocktail $12

We ordered the octopus, burrata, heirloom tomato, and Dungeness crab salad as appetizers. Our favorites were the burrata and octopus, but we all enjoyed the Dungeness salad as well. The heirloom salad was a bit of a disappointment compared to the rest.
For the pasta and protein portions we ordered the rabbit bolognese, agnolotti, black cod, and pork loin. As expected (given the chef's focus on pasta at his other restaurants) the pasta was delicious. We were split 50-50 for which of the protein dishes was better, but I was a big fan of the black cod.

But that 1/2 roasted duck...wow. When I saw it was one the website menu, I really needed to get to Haymaker. I appreciate that they do not just serve the breast of the duck, and that I was able to enjoy a phenomenal entree that was excellent value, and most importantly was perfect in flavor.

Seattle, WA","I was really excited to visit Haymaker but shortly upon entering, I realized this place is not for me. The vibe felt a little bit off/unwelcoming.
I was able to get a table without a reservation which was nice - but quickly came for realize (at least for my first visit) you have to wait 5-10 minutes to get initial drink service. I was by myself at a table below the bar area at this point, waiting for my friend.
When the server did come to my table, she was off putting. Friendly words yet came across as somewhat rude and condescending.
When my friend arrived it took the server a while for her to come to the table and get his order. When she did, he didn't get the most positIve vibe either. He ordered the same drink as I and was disappointed by the value for the price.
The server came to ask if we wanted food and we held off for a moment, debating if we wanted to stay for another drink - and for food. When we decided to ask for the check, it was evident she was annoyed by us. We saw her walk back toward the kitchen and say something to her colleague whom seemed to smile about whatever she said. We are pretty certain she spoke negatively about us at this point when we didn't ever do or say anything to her to warrant it.
I was hoping I would love this place, but nope! Not based on the service today.
I will not return to Haymaker nor recommend it to any of my friends, or otherwise.
The $14 cocktails were good though - but better worth the spend somewhere else.",,,
Haymaker,(206) 946-6994,"Andrew M.
Seattle, WA","Decent addition to the West Seattle restaurant scene. The vibe is good and the pasta is (unsurprisingly) delicious, but the rest of the menu misses the mark on execution. Notably:
- Carrots were overcooked, undersalted, and the sauce was both too oily and too thin
- ""Improved Whisky Cocktail"" was way too heavy on the absinthe
- Sous vide pork tenderloin toppings were not well balanced in proportion, and the pork was surprisingly tough for a supposed 5 hour cook.
On the plus side, the guanciale pasta was amazing - a really spectacular dish.
If I were betting, I'd wager this place improves over the coming months. That said, it's not where it needs to be for me to recommend it, at least right now.",,,

Staff: friendly and attentive.
Ambiance: love it! It has a very industrial feel but it's bright and open. It's a small restaurant but the design makes it look like it's a lot more spacious. I even found the bathroom well designed. Also love an open kitchen.
Price: HH prices are decent for the portion and quality of food.
Food: ordered the oysters, pasta and burger. The oysters were fresh and delicious. The pasta and burger were both good BUT waaaaaaay too salty. The beef from the burger was one of the best I've had in a while. It comes with cheese which may be why it was salty. In that case, there should be less salt in the beef. The pasta also came with delicious Parmesan (?) but again, so salty. Thinking about it, I should have sent them both back.
I'm on the fence of going back. There aren't a lot of places like this in West Seattle. I may ask friends if they experienced the same overly salty dish or if it was just a fluke that day.",,,

Anyway, we stopped in on a Friday afternoon, it wasn't too busy yet, so awesome. We bellied up to the bar and ordered a couple of local brews in which they had a full selection. Wow some really good stuff, you can tell they thought through and tried this stuff out before trying to sell it to me. I had forgotten about the pizza until my second drink and then I ordered. Asking the girl some questions she totally helped us pick out and determine the right size. Important stuff you know. Anyway I ordered a large Pineapple, pepperoni, and spicy sausage. Holy cow, this was some of the best pizza I've ever had. This is my new go to location for pizza. Can hardly wait to go again. So I rarely give 5 starts and usually work my way up from no stars to 5 and this place has all the reasons to go 5.
I assess a couple of different areas for each place if they warrant a full review like this one. Some are just a blurb because its McDonalds, not much to say there except 3 stars. I digress, but I assess service, food, ambiance, location, management, etc... or some derivative of these depending on the business.
Service: The best, the girl was awesome, had some great conversation, friendly, rare to find someone so positive and fun to be around. So refreshing, Thank you for being so awesome and good luck with opening your own food truck. Also what I liked was they had their regulars but they also stopped to take care of the new folks that come in and were just as attentive. Good job.
Food: Ok the best pizza I had in while. Super thin crust, lots of good sauce, and the meats were, OMG!!! Loved it. Can't say enough.
Ambiance: Low lit, small, good for a date, just nice.
Management: cleanliness, immaculate, just perfect. Had enough employees to keep service up and be on top of it.
Drinks: Selection was well thought out, had wine, craft beer, nailed it.

The pizza- I didn't hate it. I might give it a second date. The cheese is similar to margarita style. But it does cover the entire pizza. The sausage and pepperoni - very flavorful. The pizza is not too thick or too flaky. I got a small and still took half home. It's very filling.

Holy CRAP Burien! Don't tell the others....don't spread the word that this place exists.
I can't believe I have finally found a place that actually gets pasta. Like, truly gets it. This place is pretty much the pasta whisperer. I had the Gorgonzola thingy, Mozzarella rapini, and some glorious pizza that had arugula in it. I'm still salivating and its been almost 24 hours.
This place is not only a gem, but should easily be in some sort of America's best pasta places top ten list. For real.",,,

Kent, WA","Wow, what a gem!
We got here 4:30pm-4:45pm on a Saturday and there were a couple tables full. By the time we are leaving at 6pm, the place is pretty much full.
It's a good place for a date with dim lighting, fabric tablecloths and napkins, and goblets for water. Decor is elegant without being overly fancy. The place has a fancy, upscale feel but plenty of people wore jeans and a few even had t-shirts.
We tried the bruschetta on toast, the caprese salad, penne panna and I forget the name of what my boyfriend ordered but it had Gorgonzola and pistachio. The appetizer was fresh and delicious but a little small, the caprese salad was generously sized and big enough to share.
The pasta though... oh my gosh! Definitely delicious, came out piping hot, and tasted light and fresh. Very good and a generous, filling portion.
If I had to complain about anything I'd say the service was a little slow at times. My drink went empty for a while longer than I'd like, but overall the service was friendly and attentive.
The story on their website is sweet, and we saw the owner making pizza. It is a great place for couples and small groups. Will be back!!",,,

I've had several pasta dishes here from the Gnocchi al Forno to the Penne Estive and all have been good. The Insalata Primo is a great salad to start with too. The wines are always good.

Our Sister Mel lives close to here and knows the owners and chef well.... so of course we were greeted very warmly.... and I observed repeatedly every guest that came in behind us ... even if a stranger.... got the same warm Italian gracious embrace of hospitality. Everything about this evening was special.
Of course for me... the best was my ""Simple... Easy"" Spaghetti and Mussels. ""Spaghetti alle Vongole"". Spaghetti with local white Manilla Clams in the shell, white wine, lemon and garlic. OMG you gracious food gods..... it was absolutely the best pasta and clams I have ever tasted. The homemade spaghetti perfect. The wine sauce incredible... the finish I'm sure was a great olive oil... and while they don't serve anything at the table with butter.. I thought there might be a little butter in the final stages. The lemon and garlic were distinct... and bold but not sharp or harsh. You can tell I liked it! The Star.... the Clams.. and plenty of them.... steamed perfectly... tender moist tasty little bites.... surrounded by the sauce and perfect pasta.... Hell I have seen Food Heaven.

I wasn't a fan of the bread and oil/vinegar that came with. We ordered the bistecca calabrese (prime ribs) with grilled asparagus and Spaghetti al forno (baked spaghetti).
I ordered the bistecca calabrese medium rare. Delicious! One of the best steak I've ever ate. I didn't need any steak sauce. Mixed well with red wine.
The spaghetti al farno tastes like any ordinary baked spaghetti at multiple restaurants. For tonight's dinner, I recommend the bistecca calabrese.

Des Moines, WA","We have lived in Des Moines for 22 and just found this place. It will now definitely be a go to place for us. Everything was great! The only thing I could say for improvement is they give you so much calamari on the order you might run out of the yummy aioli, not that you really need it, it's great all on its own; well seasoned. Best calamari we've ever had! And the bread is very good, might be a bit better if slightly warmed. The salads were great, in fact the Insalata Primo is great with some calamari added; the lemon vinagarette goes well with the calamari (I know cheese and seafood shouldn't mix).
On the surface it may seem to be higher priced than the surrounding area, but they have good sized portions and much better food than most in the area. They offer the full multi-course Italian meal, though unless you are sharing the pasta and main course I don't know how you could make it to dessert?! We stopped at pasta and got tsiramasu to bring home. My wife had mushroom and pancetta gnocchi and said that the gnocchi was ""life changing"". I had the spaghetti with seafood; some places you get a very little seafood. I had 5-6 huge shrimp, a dozen steamer clams and 1-2 Calamari, all perfectly cooked and combined in a great tomato sauce!
Most of the reviews are very positive, the only few negative ones I've seen are about service. I give no credibility to those. Its a small place, not much staff, I could see a very needy/demanding diner feeling ignored when they are busy. You will get good polite service and have the best Italian food in the area so give it a try you won't be disappointed.",,,

Bellevue, WA","Lot of positives about this one! We were a group of 7 with a reservation at 7.45 pm but we finally got a table at 8 ish. They have no waiting area. So we had to cramp up near the door as it was cold and raining outside. The ambiance is amazing! Would be perfect for a nice date. Decor is antique and classy. The crowd is Bellevue crowd so expect to see everyone dressed fancy. Service was good not great. We had to ask for bread and no one asked us for fresh ground pepper on our pastas.
We tried their burrata plate and arancini as appetizers. Loved the burrata plate! The cheese is creamy and is perfectly balanced by the sweet onion relish! Flavor, texture, presentation - ticks all 3. The arancini on the other hand I don't think I'll get again. Nothing great about that one. All of us got pasta. I got their rigatoni. I found it a tad too tough! I understand al dente but this was more tough than I would like. The veal ragu it came with was tasty. I got to try the other pastas as well. Really liked their gnocchi and pappardelle. For desert we got their tiramisu, lemon panacotta and zepolle which are fried donut balls with Nutella. Would highly recommend the zepolle and tiramisu. The lemon panna cotta wasn't lemony enough for me, awesome texture though!

Kirkland, WA","The perfect date night spot. I think the decor is maybe farmhouse chic? Whatever it is, is modern, trendy, dim lighting during dinner, cozy intimate vibes.
The menu here is very small. If you are a picky eater, you need to take a look at the menu before you go and hope that you find a recent picture of one. I am not sure how often it changes but it is definitely not the same for a long time, maybe seasonal? Ask the restaurant if you are concerned.
The servers are very friendly and nice. They know their recommendations if you ask for one and even though busy, come to check on you.
It has been a few months since I ate here but I have been here multiple times. Even though the menu changes, it is consistent. The food is cooked perfectly, the flavors aren't just your average meal, this place really serves an experience. You will have a good time going here with people you enjoy spending time with.

Bellevue, WA","It was alright but not outstanding. The menu is very limited and so is the street parking around the restaurant. Surprised there is no parking lot or valet. Overall, prices were on a higher side for what you get. The atmosphere is cozy like a neighborhood restaurant.
As for the food, it was fine but not spectacular. The arugula salad with pistachio vinaigrette was good but not worthy of the price given it was literally just arugula and dressing with a few pieces of dried fruit on top. Brussel sprouts were okay but could've used a hint of salt, but the waitress wasn't around at the time so I could ask - although I will say that the service overall was fine. My main dish was the salmon which was the fish of the day. I was surprised how perfectly this was cooked. Definitely the star of the show. I also tried the sausage pasta dish and was underwhelmed. For an Italian restaurant that supposedly makes their pasta in house daily, I found the dish fairly mediocre.
I toyed between three and four stars but ultimately gave it four stars because there was a cute hostess that also helped serve us. While she wasn't our main waitress, I wish that she was because she was very friendly and cute, she had a great energy to her. Having energetic, friendly, attractive, happy service staff is huge and I feel like this is undervalued by a lot of restaurants these days, but definitely shouldn't be overlooked.

Host/Manager was saying no tables until 8 pm but if we wanted to sit at the bar we can. There was two seats but he asked some guests to move move two chairs so we could be accommodated at the bar. Very nice of them. The place was full.
Food looked great like last time and came out quick. The ribeye steak was perfect! Pastas are made in house, however my two friends pasta texture/bite was good BUT it was TOO salty:( Kevin, the bartender, was very friendly and quick on refilling our hot waters. Servers were nice.

My bad, but they found a seat for us! Cozy Italian dinner with incredible food. Our waitress was one of the best I have had in a while - perfect combo of friendly, knowledgeable, and super-attentive (without being overbearing). Now the food:
Cocktails: The Cantinetta Manhattan was incredible - whatever magic sauce they put in there was genius (the port?). My wife enjoyed a gin cocktail that I can't remember, since I was engrossed with the Manhattan...
Contori: House-made Focaccia in olive oil & balsamic... mmm
Antipasti: Burrata - I had never heard of this, but will be on the lookout again. Fresh mozzarella injected with cream, served with tomatoes and toasted bread. The burrata melts in your mouth, and flavor combo's were delicious.
Primi: We went with two from this section - the Risotto & Bolognese. Holy cow the flavors were bursting from the plate... so... much... flavor... enough said.

Bothell, WA","Cantinetta is a pleasant Italian restaurant right on Main Street in Old Downtown Bellevue and definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.
As always, parking in this area is tough. You can try your luck with street parking, but it may be worthwhile to just park at Bellevue Square mall and walk the 3-4 blocks to the restaurant. Decor on the inside is clean and sparse, with soft lighting and lots of wine bottles everywhere. Service was excellent and friendly; our server did a great job handling our table of 10 people. Wine selection is very, very good, but if you're a beer drinker just be aware that this restaurant only carries a few beers. Probably a space constraint. Noise level was low when I first arrived for an early dinner, but as the restaurant got more crowded, it got louder.
The food was great. For an appetizer I tried the meatballs, which were small but well made with a standout red sauce, bright and flavorful. My main course was a fresh caught salmon special that came out a touch overcooked but with delicious seasonings and a nice buttery sauce and veggies on the side.
Overall, I'd come back to Cantinetta for a nice business dinner, a casual date, or a delicious meal with friends, and look forward to returning.",,,

Seattle, WA","Tasty Italian inspired food with a pleasant atmosphere and adequate service.
My party of 5 made a reservation for a table at 6 on a sunny Tuesday evening. When we arrived, only a few other tables were occupied, but by the time we left the medium-sized restaurant was nearly full.
For drinks I ordered a gin martini with a lemon twist. The bartender also added a cucumber slice garnish which was a nice touch. The martini was good. I've have a couple slightly better martinis before but no complaints.
Our table got a couple plates of bread served with olive oil and balsamic to snack on while we waited for our main dishes to arrive. I tried the focaccia and the baguette. Both were fresh. I might prefer the focaccia a bit more, but would happily nosh on either. (We were asked if we wanted bread for our table... you might have to pay for it--it is listed on the menu for $3.5--but I'm not 100% sure.)
A few insalata mistas were ordered at my table so I had some bites of that ($9). The salad consisted of mixed greens tossed in a light vinaigrette. The amount of dressing was perfect and the greens were fresh.
For the main course I ordered the vegetarian cheese stuffed ravioli served with tomato sauce, morel mushrooms, a smattering of chopped asparagus, and sprouts?? (I think this dish was around $22.) The plating was pretty and the dish was flavorful and fresh tasting. Bright for a ravioli dish, and not too heavy or cheesy. The serving size is not big, so be sure to order a salad and bread if you're not a light eater. I also had a few bites of the seasonal vegetarian risotto ($21). The risotto was very flavorful as well. It included nettles (mixed throughout), lemon, and Parmesan. Don't let the nettles deter you, it looks more like a pesto was stirred into the risotto. The risotto is on the looser end of the spectrum... not as plump and thick as other risottos that I've had before but it was still delicious. A couple people at my table actually liked the looser aspect.
The restaurant interior is nice but casual, and the big windows facing the street open up, which is ideal on warm days. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, recommending the ravioli and risotto for vegetarian mains. They do have quite a few vegetarian options, all noted on the menu with a little star.

We started with the antipasto tray that had a great variety of meats, cheeses, nut, olives, honey comb and toasted bread. For the next course we had the pappardelle with meat sauce and the gnocchi with sausage and pear. All I can say is melt in your mouth awesome, so good. The next course we had short ribs with the Broccolini. Just when you thought the meal couldn't possible get any better, it did! The short ribs were so tender with great flavor and the Broccolini was perfectly al dente with a nice garlic flavor.

Last night I ordered the halibut special cooked in parchment and it was not pleasant. The the entire dish was lacking in flavor and the mushrooms were very gritty as if there were sand on them.

Interior is cozy and kind of a nice business casual feel. You can put in reservations so you're not waiting too long for a table.
For a party of 2, we ended up getting 3 appetizers and 1 main. We got the following and I highly recommend trying ALL of these if they fit your fancy:
- Fried sheep cheese - comes on a sizzling platter with pita
- Grilled octopus - SO freaking tender and comes with their focaccia. Let me take a moment to let you know that they make THE BEST FOCACCIA I've ever had at a restaurant. Like I would go...just to eat this again (s/o to my fellow carb lovers out there).
- Mussels - also amazing, with a creamy broth, and comes with MORE FOCACCIA omg I was crying with happiness. Dip the bread in the sauce!
- Grappa's Famous Paella (entree) - WOW. i loved how stuffed in prawns, mussels, chicken ,sausage, calamari, veg this plate was. So filling and delicious - this is big in portion so definitely share this one!
I got their Milano Mule which blew me away - I was absolutely in love with how gingery it was! and also decently boozy! Also the BEST mule I've had in Seattle so far!

As he introduced the cab he made some offhanded comment about the formerly great state of California. Being a Californian and taking it as a joke, I laughed it off and asked why. He responded with a very dry quip, making it very clear he apparently had quite the grudge against the state and didn't particularly care if I felt otherwise. It was a rather odd interaction and a slightly off putting start to the meal.
Three of us ordered the scallop picatta which was tasty but nothing amazing. Personally I think it could have used a few more capers, a handful of parsley and maybe a touch of lemon. However the scallops were cooked perfectly which I appreciated. One friend ordered the zucchini linguine which again was good but not revolutionary. The birthday girl ordered the seafood risotto which she said was good but didn't particularly knock her socks off. Honestly the star of the meal was probably the truffle burrata appetizer, however considering the price point I think they could have thrown in an entire tomato rather than 2 quarters.
Overall dinner at Grappa was good but a bit disappointing. Considering the other reviews and the slightly higher price point, I expected a little more. I would revisit Grappa again since it is in my neighborhood, however I may opt to stop in for happy hour rather than dinner.",,,

Spanakopita - 3/5. Twist with a heavy amount of yogurt. But I felt took away from the dish.
Black truffle Burrata - 4/5. Tasty Burrata and grilled tomato. Expensive but good.
Saganaki - 4/5. Fun with the dish lit on fire as it is served. Decent cheese served with pita.
Grappa flight - 4/5. Novel experience to try 3 different types of Grappa for sub $20.
Seafood risotto - 3/5. Starchy risotto. Good seafood broth flavor. Decent prawns but the smoked salmon overwhelming.",,,

Seattle, WA","Came by Grappa in the early afternoon for a group event. It was totally excellent! First off, our group was really huge - spanning at least 3 tables. The server accurately ran many separate tabs accurately and without complaint. In general the service was spot on.
The event went on for quite a while with people coming and going so I actually ordered food two different times. My first food came from the lunch menu - I had the Meatballs w. marinara, mozzarella and parmesan and the soup: Charred Cauliflower Soup w. bacon, almonds & truffle oil. I would have provided a picture of the meatballs, but I ate them before thinking of taking a photo - OOPS. Both dishes were great and I would gladly order them again. Nice presentation on both, too!
Then maybe an hour later I went for the chicken Caesar and the saganaki - fried sheep cheese for the uninitiated, like me. I'll be honest I ordered it because a) it's fried, b) it's cheese, and c) the phrase ""fried sheep's cheese"" is amusing to me. Again, both these dishes were excellent.
My only slight ding (not enough to take a star off though) is that you can't order from the happy hour menu in the 'dining area', but you can't bring kids into the bar. It's a Catch-22.
Prices were a good value, the standard Queen Anne parking caveats apply, though I was able to get a spot right outside. Kudos to our server Chynna too.",,,

The semi melted Saganaki cheese was entertaining. We ordered the Greek Lemon Chicken - meat was cooked perfectly, and the jus was.. jus-t right. Ok I'll stop that. Sorry. Lamb chops - chunky little buggers. Quite filling.
And Gem, the restaurant manager (also makes the Kizuki/Kukai ramen joints across WA) brought us a flourless chocolate cake for dessert that stole the show. If I ever met a chocolate cake that could double as construction material, it was this. And it meant that in a very good way. Dense, firm, but delicious chocolate - untainted by the frivolity of flour. Excellent dessert. Sorry - got carried away again.

Big fan of their soups - they rotate often and are amazing!! The soups in the fall are the best.
The truffle burrata, clams, focaccia bread, gnocchi, scallops pasta are some of my favorites!

The Pappardelle lacked flavor - particularly in the form of a sauce - but it was ok. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of lamb in it.

3 different people asked if we placed a drink order, (which we did) and it took 25 minutes to get them and it wasn't busy.
Then twice, while sitting at the bar having a conversation, 2 separate employees started drying and stacking plates right next to us. I literally had to ask both of them to stop because it was disruptive.

We just went again last night (Saturday at 7pm) and were able to get a table almost immediately. You can also book on Open Table if you want to make reservations on your phone.
The decor is a dark restaurant with a lot of candles with wax dripping down them. There's a really nice looking stocked bar and it's a cozy kind of feeling. Also, on Valentine's Day they have had a live musician playing music, which was really nice.
The food is consistently great here. Some of my favorites are the grilled octopus, Saganaki (a kind of grilled cheese with pita on the side), seafood (lobster) risotto, and the lamb gnocchi. Those are definitely my favorite items. There were 4 of us there last night and we just ended up sharing everything which was great! Just a note: The menu can change with seasons, so you might want to check what they have online before going.
Grappa's signature drinks are different than ones I've had at other restaurants. I was surprised that they had a Johnny Walker Black cocktail which was very good (not too sweet). They also have a tasting flight of the different Grappas they have, which is good if those who want to try to drink.
The service has always been consistently great. The waitress made great suggestions on what to order. She also consistently came by to check on us and refill our drinks.
Overall, this is a great place for dinner if you're on a date, with friends, and/or you want somewhere to just relax, drink and converse. The ambiance is very comfortable, dark, and chill. We will definitely be returning to this place.",,,

We were greeted warmly and told to sit wherever we want and we got a nice little table in the corner by the fire outside. The menu was fairly small, especially for food, which I actually love! The options were quite wonderful and I could've ordered nearly anything on the menu.
We opted to start with ""The Dark Heart"" for the cocktail and a glass of wine. Both were excellent. Our appetizer was three little fried risotto and cheese balls that were delicious!
For a main course we got the pasta with Wild Boar Ragu and goat cheese along with the Pesto Risotto topped with New York Steak. $14 and $18 respectively. Great value at such a place like this.
For dessert I got a tiramisu which was exactly what you would expect from a high-end tiramisu so it was nothing impressive or unique but it was very good. I could say the same for the cr猫me br没l茅e. It was your standard cr猫me br没l茅e but it had a really really nice taste. Everything here was done very well and the evening was wonderful. The two servers that continually took care of us were wonderful as well.

Started with the antipasti plate that was veggie heavy, easily shareable, pretty standard fare. Also had the fried stuffed olives that were salty, crunchy, rich... Good but I was done after a couple.
I was craving red meat and carbs (definitely one of those nights) so had the pesto risotto with New York strip steak. Risotto was pretty good- creamy yet still toothsome, nice pesto flavor, garlic chips sprinkled on for nice bursts of crunch and saltiness. The steak missed the spot, portion size was fine especially given the price, but it was served well done. Waiter didn't ask and I didn't think to mention my preference when i ordered, and I didn't send back because I had already started eating the risotto by the time I noticed the meat- so shared culpability but I didn't think anyone served well done steak on purpose anymore :0
Had the tiramisu and that was lovely- creamy yet still light, all the flavors and textures you want in a tiramisu...

We went there before heading to an event and while the food portions are small the price is reasonable enough you can order a few things. I had the Arancini, which they often run out of. They were fantastic. Though I love a good riceball.
Moving on to the next course I had the Fettucine carbonara. Delicious. Small, but great. Same with the cherry duck confit with polenta. Fruity, delicious, wonderfully cooked.
The tiramisu was also great, though other people I was dining with thought it was too strong.
Service is great, though we were there on a slow night. Still, I get the feeling service is always good.

We also started with the sausage stuffed olives and they were very good! My only not would be I wished there was a sauce on the side.

I ordered Carbonara, it tasted bland and a little too much black pepper, egg over cooked so I can't make the yolk leaked. However, I do the taste of this dish, so I would still recommend this. The chop salad with steak is also a good choice, steak is medium rare and cooked perfectly. Everything taste perfectly together, especially with avocado! Highly recommend the salad.

Seattle, WA","Upon wanting to explore all the cocktail bars in the Seattle area, Intermezzo Carmine not only offered cocktails but also Italian food. I went with a friend and decided to give it a shot! The space was a bit small, but it had a relaxed upscale vibe. This would be a great spot for ordering just cocktails without food as well. I'd love to come back in the summer as they have a nice outdoor seating area too.
The drinks and the food were at a typical upscale price & portion. I tried a cocktail, the glazed duck confit & the spaghetti Nero.
The cocktails were great, and exactly as i would expect at this price point. No qualms here!
The glazed duck confit as average at best, the cherry glaze didnt seem to compliment the flavor of the duck very well, and parts of the duck was overcooked and dry.
The spaghetti Nero was fantastic, it was an interesting touch to add the smoked salmon, as it was my first time having smoked salmon with the pasta but it strangely complimented the flavors well, the smokiness blended with the tomato & the creaminess seemed to blend right in with the flavors of the pasta.
Overall, it is a bit pricey for what you get, but given that this is finer dining, it was a satisfying experience. I wasn't wow'ed enough to come back again, but i would recommend coming by at least once to check out the space!",,,

Upon entering, I was in awe of its decor and atmosphere. My friends and I didn't order any drinks, but it seems like their drink selection is pretty vast and reasonably priced. We each ordered a pasta, which was on the smaller side in terms of portions. The pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and the noodle to sauce ratio was pretty good. We also ordered an appetizer to share (the risotto balls), which was only okay. The risotto tasted more like thick white rice.

Friendly, attentive, but gave us our time/space to catch up with the friends that we were with. We were waiting for the birthday girl to show up, and he was genuinely patient as he continued to bring out plates of bread to keep us preoccupied.
The fettucini carbonara was honestly perfection to me. The noodles were al dente, there was just the right amount of pancetta, and the poached egg's consistency was just as I wanted.
The waiter (I wish I got his name!) comped a tiramisu on behalf of the birthday girl, and while we told him it was OK, he insisted, and we obliged. And we were so happy that we did. They say it's a delicious 100-year old recipe and it tastes exactly like that. Best tiramisu I've had to date.",,,

With a little more than a dozen tables, this intimate little Italian restaurant is perfection. It's a little on the darker side inside, which gives it a romantic feel and on some nights, a lone guitarist plays gently by the door while you eat.
The food is wonderful. You get a plate of bread with dipping oil when you sit down and I could eat my weight in it. Then the big show. They are great if you want to substitute a pasta type into your dish(I get angel hair with my chicken Alfredo). I've never met someone who got a dish there that they didn't love. The portions are great as well. I always end up taking some of it home to enjoy later.
My only gripe that took a star is that all three times I have gone, the service is slow. It takes a while to get drinks refilled and the time between coming in, ordering and getting your food is just a tad too long. Refilling drinks is always a big thing to me.

She rarely smiled and almost seemed like she didn't care to be there, it's always pretty unsavory to me when you have someone working customer service that acts in such a way. I've managed multiple food establishments before and having employees that exude good customer service should be of the utmost importance.
Now, the food, the Gnocchi was good, not the best gnocchi we have had as it was a bit gummy, but it was good enough. The ravioli was good but how can you screw up fried ravioli. The Risotto was delicious, and I mean very very delicious. Great flavor! No regrets about ordering it.
The creme brulee was enjoyed greatly by my mother in law however I believed the flavor was a bit odd, mostly the consistency was kinda funky and it definitely was not the best creme brulee I've had before. The cannolis were pretty good, in fact it was nice to see that they truly were a sweetened ricotta filling whereas a lot of places around here almost taste more like a cream cheese frosting filling so this was pleasant to see they were more traditional. The chocolate flourless cake was a different texture than the average flourless cake but it was still good flavor, only wish that the piece was cut a little larger for the price.
Overall, the food was good, we would definitely be back for it again, service could use a remodel though ;)",,,

The first time I went the service was lack luster, but the coffee & tiramisu were both to die for. The second time was fantastic, both my husband and I adored our meals. Tonight I decided to try my luck and order to go, as it's raining like crazy outside. I got home, so excited to enjoy my calzone, just to find that it was both burnt and cold. My husbands chicken sandwich was also burnt and cold. I guess it's just a hit & miss kind of place. Definitely won't be ordering to go food from here ever again though.",,,

That being said the reason why I gave them 3 stars is the last few times I have ordered their calamari it was quite rubbery and doughy. I still love it here but I love it a hella of a lot better if the consistency with the appetizers stays on point",,,

Port Orchard, WA","Fist visit here, my friwnd reccomended the place. The menu had many options and it took me a bit to even make a choice.
They had given us some bread to dip and some olive oil and Seasonings, I very much light the olive oil seasoning mixture.
Had the gnocchi with pesto, very tasty. But are the gnocchi supposed to be gooey? (Id only eaten it from the store, and the texture was different) i wished they had a smaller portion (not just to save on cost, but when i reheated it at home it was a pile of goo.. Perhaps gnocchi should not be reheated?)
I did like that they had a kods menu, kinda wished they gave them a veggie with thoer meal (my daughter got nuggets and fries) price was good for the kids meal though.
Service was outstanding, there was one person there to serve all the tables. She was very kind seeing that she allowed us so much time to be able to look over the menu.
My friend had given me a bite of her meal she had tortellini with some sausage and hers was amazing. I'll order hers next
I also got to try to different desserts, be no flour chocolate cake with raspberry was divine, and the Tiramisu cake was refreshing.
I will come back here again and try more of their food to see whether I want to go back again.",,,

Olympia, WA","I was very excited to try this place, and I had a valpack too. Housemade sangria was very yummy, the happy hour large was an okay size. A lot of ice and a thick glass made it seem larger than it was, I think.
We tried the fried ravioli and ordered the bruschetta. I'd never tried fried ravioli before?? It was bomb, obviously, it's probably pretty hard to screw that up. Instead of bruschetta we were served caprese salad on bread which, if I'm being honest, we didn't realize until after we left. It was pretty decent, the bread they served it on was the same as the dipping bread you get which is fine, tasty, maybe a little old. I would have liked it crunchier. We got in the car and I was like, wait.. that was not bruschetta 鈥?He really liked the lemony chicken and capers thing I forget what it's called. i think chicken picatta. I thought it was too damn lemony but I also don't know what it's supposed to taste like. He ate almost all of it except the veggies that were just like steamed with some sort of garlicness.
I got the housemade gnocchi with meat sauce and meatballs and, well, I was very disappointed. The texture of the gnocchi was good, but the sauce and meat was SO salty it was almost inedible. I wish there was more of the fresh white cheese dolloped on top because that really helped mellow it out. The meatballs were kind of tasty, but over cooked.
Overall, just disappointing . The woman working there was very nice and patient with our deciding but it was soooo salty!
I settled on two stars because the ravioli and his food was good, the caprese was okay but not what we'd ordered, and I choked down the gnocchi. Perhaps I'll try it again some time because a lot of people love it, but I just was not pleased.",,,

Poulsbo, WA","The two stars is purely for service. I ordered takeout here 2 days ago. The hostess was courteous, prompt and accommodating. No issues with service. I ordered a house salad...salad would have been fine if it was not dressed at the restaurant. Generally in to-go orders the restaurants package the dressing separately so that the salad doesn't wilt into mush. The next dish was fried calamari. The calamari was over cooked, tasted like the product was purchased pre-made and fried in house. The sauce that was given with it reminded me of a tablespoon of marinara in a cup of hot water. The spaghetti Bolognese was greasy, as if the noodles were coated in butter or oil, and a few measly bits of meat clung to the noodles, no ragu to really speak of. A copious amount of unidentifiable cheese was melted on top. The tortellini in a Parmesan cream sauce (because let's be real, that was not Alfredo) was somehow both chewy and mushy, as well as bland. There were a couple of items that came with the meal. The bad: Stale bread with a dipping sauce. The good (and overwhelmingly best part of the meal): Andes Mints. There was a sign in the window that said they were hiring waitstaff, but I would strongly recommend hiring a new executive chef.",,,

But I just had Sebi's Bistro delivered to my house and I am in AWE. I woke from a nap after a stressful day of work and an oncoming migraine to a delivery of perogi - half meat, half potato. The meat were good, the borsht was good, but the potato? Honestly, they're on my top 10 foods I've ordered during this whole fiasco.

This is very good! The pretzel twist is extremely soft and doughy. It's also slightly crispy in certain areas, especially towards the end. The marinara sauce that it comes with has finely diced garlic. My only complaint is that I wish there was a little bit more of that delicious pesto sauce.
Gypsy Stew Score: 3.5/5
I had really high expectations for this one. The beef stew comes with a side of sauerkraut and potatoe pancakes. The stew had way to much salt and the pancakes were burnt to a crisp. If they fixed those two problems this dish would probably be a 4.5/5. Overall, it was not bad and I really enjoyed it.

Seattle, WA","Came here for dinner one night. I'd had this place bookmarked for SOOO long. We got the polish platter and beef stew over potato pancakes. We also got the pretzel covered cheese bites and stuffed clams.
The pretzel bites came out first and they were essentially fried dough stuffed with cheese with a beer cheese sauce. It was delicious (how could it not be?), but they weren't pretzel bites at all (you know, the baked, buttery kind with big salt crystals), which was what we were expecting.
The stuffed clams were OK. They were mostly cheese.
The polish platter came with a stuff cabbage roll, kielbasa, and pierogis. The menu didn't say what kind of pierogis they'd be. They turned out to be cheese pierogis and I really wanted meat pierogies. My fault, I should have asked. The stuff cabbage roll was OK but my husband loved it. The kielbasa and the accompanying mustard was good.
The beef stew was served over potato pancakes and it would've been so much better if the stew wasn't completely soaking the pancakes, turning them into mush. I did manage to get a tiny crispy edge. The beef was tough and flavorless. There won't be a next time, but if there were, I'd ask for the stew to be served on the side, or at least covering only half the pancakes like I see in other photos. We brought half of this home but ended up not eating it.

We picked a table in front of the big screen that was playing the hawks game. The hanging lights above each table blocked a little of the view but no big deal.
We ordered off the lunch menu which goes until 4pm and then happy hour 3-6 so it overlapped for a little but unfortunately there's no Wells drinks on happy hour.
Started off with 6 buffalo wings and they came out hot and were good.
I ordered cheese ravioli with a mix of their marinara and Alfredo sauce, it comes with bread and a salad. Came out on the colder side so I asked her to microwave it a bit and it came back perfect temp.
Pizza was good as well but a little too much cheese for me, I only had one bite though.
Our waitress was extremely nice. I would come back.",,,

Seattle, WA","I had a pizza Togo from here before and full transparency, maybe it was the different toppings we ordered, but today ain't it. My friends and I went to this restaurant with the assumption that they had bottomless mimosas because 1) It's on the website and 2) well it's on the menu. We asked the server when they got rid of it and he unconfidently said a week ago. Didn't argue but that's frustrating. Cross it out of the menu.
We ordered the chipotle chicken pizza and the flavor was lacking. Another reviewer mentioned heavy cheese and yes it is true. However, that did not compensate for the lack of flavor in this pizza. The cheese garlic bread was great but also that's difficult to mess up. This two star rating was only helped by this bread.
If you don't mind flies flying around indoors, not bottomless mimosas, below average pizza, this is your place. Please reconsider, West Seattle has better pizza spots.",,,

Marysville, WA","Follow Pegasus On Instagram and their posts and stories always look SO Delicious, very disappointed. Came here on a Saturday night and got a seat right away in the bar. There was also many tables available in the non bar area. We got waters right away and were asked if we wanted drinks. after getting drinks we ordered our appetizers, cheese bread, with a side of marinara for $3.99, Mediterranean salad, and chicken wings. Sadly our chicken wings never came. We ordered the chicken chipotle pizza for dinner and the chicken pesto ravioli. The pizza tasted more like mushrooms than chipotle but loved the crust and the different cheese. The ravioli was amazing but both pizza and pasta weren't really hot? Overall their pictures look better than the actual food. Especially for a $70 dinner for 2 we expected something way better. Won't be back sadly.",,,

Kirkland, WA","Great location at Alki Beach with outdoor seating and waterfront view. The staff is super friendly, and the bartender is fun. If you give her the go ahead, she'll make up a drink for you. I had a version of a French 75 that was great. I think the highlight of the pizza here is the shredded pepperoni which is fantastic if you like it crispy almost to a well done bacon characteristic. I loved the pepperoni! The pizza was good. I would like a choice option in crust because I am starting to really like thin crust, and Pegasus is a little bit thicker but soft crust and still good. We had the Tom special which had several toppings including feta cheese. Definitely a repeat visit for me.",,,

I ordered a Cesar salad the Hercules pizza. My drink was called Aphrodite and it was delicious. I don't drink as much as I used to otherwise I have had two more. The server, Ralaina, was really nice. We did a half and half pizza and they put onions on my side so it kind of ruined the taste for me. Everything else was great. They played 80s music and we sat outside. I really enjoyed the experience.",,,

Seattle, WA","We ordered 2 fettuccines with prawns. My husband specifically mentioned he wanted a Caesar salad. I mentioned I wanted the salmon chowder.
Only one salmon chowder came out. Then the lady brought out one fettuccine prawn for my husband... with a spoon...
5 min later when she came back, I asked if my husband is going to get his salad and if I'm getting my fettuccine and she never even put the order in. She said oh ok I'll bring your salad out...
What? I said I wanted a fettuccine with prawns 3x. She never listened.
I can't with this place.
This is the 4th time I came here where the service and food was just mediocre. I don't think I am going to come back here for awhile.
The manager was kind enough to chime in. So I changed this review from 1 star to 3. I'm being generous.
Me and my husband worked hard over the week and we wanted to enjoy our Friday evening on Alki beach. And this happens... I couldn't even eat with my own husband at the same time. What's the point of going on a dinner date?",,,

The overall vibe in the restaurant was a little depressing, and needs updating. The waiters were very nice, just ours was not super attentive.
Street parking. Nice views.",,,

The restaurant itself was freezing-everyone kept their jackets on while dinning. Decor dated and seating is cramped. Overpriced for the overall ""meh"" experience.

Pegasus Pizza,(206) 932-4849,"Jovan L.
Seattle, WA","Great pizza, but I have trouble with one of the hostesses who can never get my order correct because she doesn't know the whole menu.
In my second time ordering the pizza (first time by phone), I thought I'd be good with describing the pizza because I couldn't remember the name. I specified that it had artichoke. But I ended up confused and eventually agreed to the pizza she believed to be the right one (which didn't even have artichoke, a unique and easily identifiable ingredient IMHO). I ended up taking home a different pizza than what I wanted (It was good, but that's an extra star for the company and kitchen staff.).
Third time, I specified clearly that the pizza I wanted was an item on the white insert inside of the full menu. I was disconnected because that same hostess took too long asking the kitchen staff if the pizza was still ""available."" I called back and ordered with another hostess. When I went to pick up, I wanted to point out the menu item to the hostess I continue to have issues with so that there would be no confusion in the future. I ended up settling with one of her coworkers and hoped they would mention this with her at another time.
Fourth time, I figured I had all the kinks worked out that somebody on their first day could find the pizza that I wanted to order. NOPE. Same hostess, same ""availability"" issue. But this time, I was able to speak with her and she said it'll never happen again. We'll see. For now, all I have are three less than satisfactory experiences that could have easily been remedied by an employee learning the simple menu offerings.",,,

Seattle, WA","Underrated. If you want some unique pizza for a fair price, this is your place. I come here at least once a year for their Tom's Special pizza. The crispy pepperoni shreds on top will leave you craving to come here every time you're in West Seattle. I'd also recommend the Italian salad. The ambiance isn't spectacular and the drink selection is slim, but if pizza is on your mind and you're at Alki this is where you want to come.

Issaquah, WA","Pegasus on Alki has been a family tradition of ours for my entire life. I can't remember a time where we had visitors from out of the country/state come visit us where we did not come here.
For me I love the nostalgia behind this place; the amazing food, and the views of the Sound. When I say that we have been coming here my entire life, I am really not exaggerating. We have spent decades coming here and have never had a bad experience.
Most recently, I had the pleasure of having my entire immediate family together for Thanksgiving. We all agreed to have 1 full day of family time and without question, Pegasus was the first thing we all agreed on for lunch. We arrived a little after opening time - 11 am, and were immediately seated. Our server, Reuben, was a young guy who had a lot of spirit and his service was great! We really appreciated how social he was with us and never left our glasses go without being refilled.
We are pretty consistent with what we order. We always order the Alki special - no onions, shredded pepperoni ON TOP, and lots of bleu cheese to dip. The Alki Special is great because it has spicy pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, yummmm. There is something magical about the bleu cheese here. I am somewhat of a self proclaimed bleu cheese connoisseur and this place has some of the best! We also ALWAYS order the feta bread. OMG this bread is LIFE. Perfectly warm, chewy, gooey feta bread.
They recently remodeled, so they actually opened up the place a lot more. The bar is really cool and exposed, unlike how it used to be attached to the hostess station. They make great drinks and always have amazing local brews on tap.
The best part is that after you finish stuffing your face with loads of amazing carbs, you can cross the street and either rent a Lime bike to roam around the beach or just stroll and admire the beauty that is the Seattle skyline.",,,

Austin, TX","Dined in for lunch. Ambiance is okay. Service is good; staff friendly. Ordered an Italian Sausage Pizza, and Rosemary Chicken Ravioli. The pizza tasted maybe just okay, with the bread too spongy and hollow unlike transitional pizza base, overloaded with extra cheese and tomato sauce, sausage too dry and bland flavors. The ravioli was a disaster with chicken undercooked. We sent back the dish that came to us overcooked, may be they just redid the old dish. We cancelled that and sent back for good. For the quality of the food and ambiance, the prices are high and probably not worth it.",,,

The only food that was served fast was chicken rice soup which tasted like canned soup. The pizza has a thick crust. I haven't had thick crusted pizza for a while but it tastes ok. We also ordered classic Italian meatball pasta which tastes standard except it's drowned in a pool of olive oil.",,,

Pros:
Great for groups, lots of space and doesn't get too crowded which I like. Our server Andrew was amazing and really went out of his way to give us great service.
Cons:
Apparently they released a new menu the day before we came and boy if I knew I would NOT have come here. Way over priced for the type of food you get, basic bar food at restaurant prices. I was planning on coming and getting food all afternoon for the game but fries alone were almost 10$ after tax. Way way way overpriced for what food you get. My group ordered wings (which were good), nachos (alright), backyard burger (burnt) and drinks for each of us. Our bill was over $100. Somethings off if they think this will bring people in.",,,

I got to the eatery about 30 minutes after they opened. There were only two others in the restaurant. The bartender chatted up all the patrons and was so nice to interact with. Food came out quickly and the plates were properly warmed. I was impressed that the place had large screen TVs all around each wall of the space which was great. My only gripe was they were mounted close to the ceiling. So Monday Night Football was on the screen in front of me at the bar and I had to strain my neck a little. All in all a decent spot. I really want to rate this higher, but with the prices/portion ratio is a bit off. I will visit again when there are more patrons. Would like to see service with more people in the spot",,,

The salad itself was large and had a good portion of steak on it. The salad was fresh and so were all the toppings. The steak was seasoned perfectly and was cooked perfectly. Medium rare to medium. The dressing the salad dressing that came with the salad brought all the flavors together and really set the salad off. I can go on record and say that this is by far one of the best salads that i have ever had. My friends order a Cajun Chicken sandwich and they said that it was delicious as well.

i met up with my folks here after work around 6. the pub is located at the end of a small lot that's shared with a gas station & a few other small stores. when you walk in it's pretty spacious inside. not really booths but lots of tables n chairs & a bar.
i ordered the large cajun chicken cesar salad 5/5: i was really excited about eating this. the portion of chicken was perfect with the amount of lettuce given. it came with parmesan, & croutons! the dressing wasn't heavy at all & i appreciated this because i was able to feel more refreshed after chowin dooown

Place was pretty slow with a couple other patrons. Server was welcoming and pretty cool. We had a table by the window. There was a lot of space.
I had a cocktail called Rob Roy. It was average.
Appetizer was crab cakes. It was surprisingly a lot. Came with 2 patties the size of a bk whopper.
Entree was was seared ahi tuna. It was decent. Tuna tasted fresh. Visually, it looked pretty light. But it got me pretty full. Maybe because the crab cakes were so huge. Overall, I can't give too many points for vibes, since it was a Sunday night. Flavors for pretty average, but quality of ingredients keep it above average. I'd say if you're looking for a chill place to have a conversation, this is a good place. If you're a flavor hunter, it's pretty average.",,,

I asked the server if I could have the chicken sandwich from the old menu and he said yes. WHoooHOOOO. Unfortunately when it came out it is not the same sandwich. It is sliced chicken on a bun. This does not make a good sandwich. The pieces kept falling out of the bread. It was a horrible way to eat. The original was the reason I came to the brick repeatedly.

She was doubling as a bartender too. It took around 40 more minutes to get our food...that's almost an hour since we got there. Not acceptable. Fish from fish and chips was over fried and hard.

With that said...
I have now had three bad meals in a row and I am ready to stop trying. That is big bucks I will never get back. How do you screw up a BLT? The bacon was so overcooked that it was more like burnt bacon dust than meat. The ""Philly cheese steak"" was not good and didn't even come with the advertised aioli sauce. My fries sucked and were cold. How on Earth can you make a bad cheese steak? I don't even remember what they screwed up before that but I still remember the dissapointment coupled with a 70 dollar check.

We sat the table for 15 mins and neither of them brought a menu or said Hi to us. After I began staring at the girl wondering why we were being ignored, a white couple came in and sat at the bar. Within 30 seconds he had poured them waters and took their order. He made their drinks and we had yet to be greeted or brought a drink menu.
